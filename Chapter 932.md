# Chapter 932 - Setting Off!

The Nightmare Eyes Technique<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">[1]</a></sup> contained the power to deliver a strong shock to the mind. Its ability to invisibly affect a person’s mental state allowed it to have a certain effect in battle.  This was the method that Wang Baole had secretly used just now.

He indeed wanted Li Linzi to make a move on him just now. According to the rules, as long as Li Linzi attacked first, his qualifications would be revoked. Wang Baole had no doubts about this.

And if Li Linzi had no qualifications, then Wang Baole could kill him without losing his own qualifications for the Starfall Realm. Of course, this was also because Wang Baole thought Li Linzi was an eyesore. With his temper, after the other party had provoked him repeatedly, it wasn’t easy to hold back until now.

“I should’ve just thrown him off the boat earlier.” Wang Baole snorted. In his mind, he was thinking that since Li Linzi didn’t know what was good for him, he should find a chance to kill the other party when nobody was around.

“And that bell girl, why is she so nosy!” Ignoring the gazes behind him, Wang Baole walked into the inn and returned to his room.

After all, more than half of the three-day resting period had already passed, and there was only one day left. Wang Baole planned to adjust his cultivation and keep himself in peak condition for the next Starfall trial.

Just like that, time passed slowly. It soon became night, and the white paper moon radiated a soft light in the sky that illuminated the entire Starfall City. At the same time, all the Chosen also returned to their rooms, adjusting their cultivation in order to prepare for the trial that would start at dawn.

Midnight passed in silence, and soon it was only three hours before dawn. Wang Baole was in a state of meditation. His even breathing was in harmony with his cultivation base fluctuations, and he seemed to have merged with the surrounding void. Suddenly, his eyebrows twitched!

His eyes flew open in an instant. He quickly looked at his storage bag, showing an expression of surprise. At that moment, his storage bag opened on its own and the storage ring inside also opened automatically. The paper human cutout inside the storage ring stuck its head out, and with a strange expression on its face, it flew out of the storage ring. In an instant, it appeared…right in front of Wang Baole!

Wang Baole’s complexion changed and his breathing became rapid. A strange laugh echoed in his head, causing his cultivation base to become chaotic. At the same time, his forehead started sweating. He wanted to get up, but was shocked to find out that he had lost control of his body!

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t make his body move one bit. He could only sit there, unable to even close his eyes. With a horrified expression, he watched as the paper human cutout turned from the size of a palm to the size of an ordinary adult.

Seemingly unaccustomed to this height, the paper human cutout moved around the room until it got comfortable. It then raised its head and stared at Wang Baole.

Just looking at the paper human cutout caused stinging pain in Wang Baole’s eyes, but he was still unable to close them. Fortunately, the paper human cutout looked away after giving him a glance. As it stood by the window, it seemed to be looking up at the paper moon in the sky. After a while, just when Wang Baole’s eyes started watering, the paper human cutout disappeared.

Once it disappeared, Wang Baole instantly regained control of his body. He quickly closed his eyes while trying to keep calm. After a while, he opened them again. He stared at the place where the paper human cutout had vanished and checked the storage ring to confirm that the other party really had left. Wang Baole’s eyes slowly narrowed, and coldness rapidly filled them.

“This paper human cutout helped me board the Starfall Boat many times. It must have wanted to use me to enter here!”

“This way of entering is a bit like smuggling…” Wang Baole suddenly felt a little guilty. He felt that there might be some shocking changes occurring in the Starfall Realm this time around, and the changes would most likely be related to the paper human cutout he had brought in.

“Forget it, I’m also a victim!” Wang Baole sighed. After comforting himself, he realized that there was still a living person in his storage bag, so he quickly checked and found that the Chosen of the Violet Gold Civilization was still alive. With that, he breathed a sigh of relief.

He absolutely couldn’t let the other party die, at least until he returned to the Divine Eye Civilization and found that everything was still safe. At this moment, after realizing that the Chosen was fine, Wang Baole was about to withdraw his divine sense, but after thinking about the smuggling of the paper human cutout, he suddenly had a thought in his heart.

“I don’t know if other people can be smuggled in like this…” Wang Baole suppressed this idea. In fact, if it was really that simple to smuggle someone in, the Starfall Empire wouldn’t have existed for such a long time.

Just in case, Wang Baole tried to take out the Chosen of the Violet Gold Civilization from his storage bag, but soon realized that although other items could be taken out, living things couldn’t be brought out of the storage bag. Apparently, there were natural law that interfered, making smuggling almost impossible.

“The paper human cutout was successful because it’s a native!” Wang Baole narrowed his eyes and finally saw that dawn was approaching. Therefore, he suppressed his inner thoughts and kept himself calm. After readjusting his cultivation, the sky outside gradually brightened up.

Right before dawn arrived, a mighty voice abruptly echoed in the minds of Wang Baole and the other Chosen here.

“The trial has commenced!”

As the words echoed, an unfathomable force instantly spread throughout the inn. Although the force disappeared almost instantly, the sound of crashing waves rang out from outside. At first, the sound was similar to that of ocean waves, but after listening closely, it was actually more like paper strips falling on top of each other.

Wang Baole was no stranger to this sound. His eyes suddenly widened, and he quickly got up and went straight to the window. When he looked outside, his eyes swiftly shrank, and what he saw…was no longer the streets of Starfall City, but the endless…Black Paper Sea!

It was as if the previous three days were just hallucinations. Wang Baole’s Divine Sense immediately spread out, and he found himself on a giant and boundless boat.

There was no paper human cutout on this boat,  but it crashed through the waves and sped along all on its own. It was so fast that the Black Paper Sea in front of Wang Baole seemed like a long streak of countless black paper strips flying backward.

“This movement method…” Wang Baole’s eyes narrowed.

There were hundreds of rooms in the cabin of this boat, and he was in one of them!

All of the other cultivators in the other rooms were also shocked at this moment. One after another, they got up and looked around. Even the bell girl had a strange light in her eyes.

However, these Chosen from big families and tyrannical forces were naturally extraordinary, so they quickly composed themselves. It was at this time that the domineering voice from the paper human cutout echoed in everyone’s minds again.

“If you are a cultivator from the Outer Domain and want to obtain serendipities in my Starfall Realm, you need to pass three trials. You all have already passed the first trial, and now it's time for the second!

“This trial is one of elimination. At the destination ahead of you, there is a Special Planet called the Illusory Planet. There…all lives that died by your hands will be transformed into illusory figures to hinder you!”

“Once you get past these obstacles, there are thirty Illusory Crystals in the Illusory Planet. The moment you step foot onto the Illusory Planet, the people holding the Illusory Crystals will pass the second trial and enter the final trial after seven days!”

“There is only one day until your arrival… so cherish this period of peace.” The voice slowly dissipated, and the boat fell into silence, including Wang Baole. He felt that something was wrong.

In reality, he wasn’t the only one thinking this. Most of the Chosen in the other rooms, except for a few who didn’t know much, had similar doubts in their hearts. Compared to the ancient records, there were some inconsistencies in the Starfall Realm journey. There seemed to be some extra trials this time!

“Coming to the Starfall Realm was one trial. After entering Starfall City, there is another trial. After passing the second trial, there will be a final trial…what’s going on in the Starfall Realm this time? Maybe other people know the reason? Wang Baole narrowed his eyes, thinking about whether to inquire information from others. However, at this moment, as if it heard the question in his heart, a familiar sharp voice suddenly echoed in his mind. An eerie laughter rang out, and words were transmitted directly into Wang Baole’s mind.

“That’s because…this may be the last time the Starfall Realm will ever be opened!”

      <li id="fn-1">This is interesting. You might know this from the translation “Demonic Eye Art”, yet that is actually incorrect. The raw for this technique is 魇目诀. Literally: (to have a nightmare) (eye) (secret art). Well, because this technique is about spawning a bunch of devilish eyes based on how many living beings one has killed, I will be translating this as the Nightmare Eyes Technique from now on (Chinese doesn’t differentiate between singular and plural). <span class="footnotereverse"><a href="#fnref-1">↩</a></span></li>

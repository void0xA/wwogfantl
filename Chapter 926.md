# Chapter 926 - Divine Might Dao Lightning

As soon as he flew up, Wang Baole immediately understood why the first batch of Chosen who soared into the sky had trembled the moment they rose into the air. Some of them had almost fallen into the black paper sea due to insufficient preparation.

That was because there was a strong pressure in the sky. This pressure gave Wang Baole the feeling that there was a heaven-shaking mountain suddenly pressing down on his body. Despite his own powerful strength, he was still shaken. Even though his body didn't sink, his cultivation base was thrown into disorder.

‘Not only does it increase the weight on me, but it also affects my cultivation!’ Wang Baole narrowed his eyes. However, he was not an ordinary person. He could still withstand the heavy pressure and chaotic cultivation base. In fact, if he slowed down and calmed his cultivation base, the effects of the pressure would gradually decrease.

However, it was clear… that the assessment wouldn't be so simple. As such thoughts surfaced in Wang Baole's mind, he saw that among the first batch of cultivators who had flown out a thousand feet ahead, some had slowed down, and their bodies began to twist and turn. Among them were around three or four people who had almost fallen into the sea previously. Although they had regained their balance, they were now trembling again. In fact, as terror appeared on their faces, they fell towards the sea of paper again.

Of the four people who fell this time, three of them managed to recover, but one of them was unlucky. He originally could have recovered and returned to the air, but the moment he fell, a huge wave rose up and enveloped him. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t change the outcome of his legs turning into black paper!

As he screamed, he lost control of his body and was quickly completely submerged. In just a few breaths of time, his body turned into a black paper human cutout and disappeared in the waves.

This scene shocked everyone. Wang Baole's complexion changed as well. As for the other three who had almost fallen, their faces were pale, and their eyes were filled with fear. They didn't dare to continue advancing and instead retreated hastily.

As a result, the seventy to eighty people in the first batch were immediately divided into different groups. The first group was obviously the four including the masked woman. They had already flown nearly ten thousand feet ahead. The second group behind them had more than fifty people. Although they were very cautious and therefore much slower, they seemed able to persist for a while.

As for the rest… after seeing someone die, they did not dare to fly anymore. Their expressions kept changing, caught in a dilemma.

At the same time, the second and third batches of Chosen also flew out. They had seen the situation, but if they didn't leave the spirit boats, what awaited them would still be failure. They might as well give it their all!

All of this made Wang Baole wary. He was about to unleash his speed in mid-air, but at that moment, the masked woman’s group of four, who were originally speeding ahead, suddenly stopped ten thousand feet away. Although their speed quickly returned to normal, a glint flashed in Wang Baole's eyes.

After he observed the rest and spread his Divine Sense out, Wang Baole immediately determined that the pressure here… would increase exponentially with the increase in speed and flying distance. In other words, it would become increasingly difficult to maintain a normal speed!

"No wonder the limit is five days!"

‘If I want to maintain a speed that will allow me to reach the shore within five days, the pressure I'll have to face will reach an extremely terrifying level…’ Wang Baole took a deep breath. Even though it was difficult, he still felt that he should be able to do it. At this moment, his body shook and his speed increased explosively. Even though the sudden increase in pressure affected his cultivation base, it was unable to stop him. In just a few breaths, he was already five thousand feet away.

This scene stood out amongst the crowd, causing many people behind him to reveal looks of shock. Even the masked woman’s group of four in front of him turned their heads slightly towards Wang Baole.

In fact, if this explosive speed could be maintained, Wang Baole would only need a few more breaths to catch up to the four of them. Even though they were confident that they would not fall behind, if Wang Baole caught up, they had to admit that he had the right to advance alongside them.

"Who is this person?"

"This speed is so violent!"

Various thoughts surfaced in everyone's minds. However… the development of the situation was different from what everyone had imagined. Wang Baole was brimming with confidence, but just as he was about to catch up to the four frontrunners in one go… suddenly, his hair stood on end. The red lightning that had previously vanished without a trace now abruptly appeared out of thin air, striking towards Wang Baole!

"F*ck your sister!" Wang Baole screamed. He immediately recognized that this lightning was from the side effect of the wishing bottle. He retreated hastily, but it was too late. He was struck instantly.

As he screamed, Wang Baole was almost thrown into the Black Sea. After barely stabilizing himself, his body trembled, and madness appeared in his eyes. The anger in his heart reached its peak.

"You old bastard!" Wang Baole roared. It was clear that the lightning had been hiding here for a long time. It didn’t strike when Wang Baole had just left the boat, nor did it strike him when he was in the air earlier. Instead, it waited for Wang Baole to unleash his full speed before striking immediately.

This made Wang Baole feel that the lightning was extremely sinister. At the same time, his vigilance was raised to the maximum. However, just as his anger was about to flare up, in the distant sky, dozens of red lightning bolts appeared instantly. Behind them, hundreds more lightning bolts were also brewing. If one looked further, one could see tens of thousands or even more gradually appearing from the void.

Wang Baole blinked. Letting out a pained cry, his anger instantly disappeared into cowardice as he turned around and unleashed his full strength, rushing towards the Starfall Boat that he was on previously, five thousand feet away.

At his back, dozens of red lightning bolts chased after him. When the surrounding people saw this, they were all stunned. Even the first batch of people in the distance were shocked.

"Could it be that in the first assessment, other than the pressure and disruption of the cultivation base, there is also a Lightning Tribulation!"

"What's going on? Why is it striking only him?"

"This lightning… looks familiar…"

Amidst the confused crowd, there were a few Chosen who had previously been on the same boat as Wang Baole. Upon seeing this scene, they instantly understood what was going on. In particular, Li Linzi’s eyes turned red with anger as he roared.

"Xie Dalu, so you're the one who attracted the lightning!"

The others who were on the same boat as Wang Baole also stared at him angrily. However, Wang Baole was not in the mood to bicker with them now. Under the pursuit of dozens of lightning bolts, he rushed back and directly returned to the boat.

There weren't many cultivators left on the boat. There were only seven or eight of them, and all of them seemed a little anxious. It wasn't that they didn't want to leave, but they felt that with their level of cultivation, it would be difficult for them to successfully reach the shore after leaving the boat.

The assessment might seem simple, but actually, in the entire Never-Ending Dao Domain, 99% of cultivators at the great circle of Spirit Immortal realm would not be able to pass it!

That was why they didn't pay much attention to Wang Baole's return. Instead, they gathered together and unleashed their cultivation. It seemed that they wanted to join forces to suppress the Resentful Qi and delay the boat’s transformation into paper for as long as possible. That way, they could advance that little bit farther and have that little bit better of a chance to reach the other side.

Actually, they weren't the only ones who did this. Some cultivators on the other boats chose this method as well. However, the results weren't ideal. Right now, the Wang Baole’s boat had already been mostly turned into black paper and clearly wouldn't be able to hold on for much longer. At this moment, Wang Baole's body suddenly landed on the boat and the dozens of red lightning bolts that were chasing after him also landed and hit the boat with a loud boom.

The entire boat shook slightly. Just like in the past, it didn't show much of a reaction. It seemed to be able to resist the power of lightning. However… the Resentful Qi in the Black Sea that was coiling around the boat was like a mouse that had seen a cat. It had a huge reaction and instantly retreated. In some places where it couldn't dodge in time, a scream could be heard after it was struck by the lightning. The Resentful Qi dissipated, and the exposed area of the boat recovered from its transformation into paper!

Everyone on the boat stared in shock. Even the Chosen mid-air stared with wide eyes, disbelief written on their faces.

Even Wang Baole himself was stunned for a moment. His eyes then gleamed and he suddenly raised his head to look at the dumbfounded Li Linzi, who had just shouted at him, and snorted with contempt.

"Idiot, this Dao Son is casting a spell to cleanse the entire Black Sea and return this world to its former glory!" As he spoke, he raised his right hand and pretended to form a seal.

"Divine Might Dao Lightning, come!"

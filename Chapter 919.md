# Chapter 919 - I Must Eat Them!

“Little bastard!!” Watching the spirit boat disappear into the distance, Daoist Lin Hai had an indescribable anger in his heart. Even though he felt incredibly distressed and wanted to slaughter everything around him, he had to admit that he made a mistake this time.

His mistake was underestimating Long Nanzi. Originally, he could have charged into the Divine Eye civilization’s Eternal Star and killed Long Nanzi the moment he arrived, but he didn’t do so due to the pressure from the Xie Family.

At the end of the day, he had underestimated the other party’s boldness. But most importantly… the paper human cutout on the spirit boat had actually chosen to help!

This incident was beyond his imagination. As far as he knew, something like this had never happened before!

As for the previous threat and counter-threat, Daoist Lin Hai was in a dilemma. It would have been fine if Long Nanzi had killed his Violet Gold civilization’s Heavenly Chosen, since he could then decisively carry out his threat. But Long Nanzi wasn’t stupid; he didn’t kill Xing Ling, but captured him alive. Lin Hai didn’t dare to thoughtlessly take action, so he could only narrow his eyes while suppressing his killing intent and trying to decide his next course of action.

The expression on his face grew increasingly unsightly and he seemed to be on the verge of exploding in rage. Zhang Tian, who was standing a short distance away, broke out in a cold sweat. His face was pale as he stared at Wang Baole, who was gradually disappearing into the distance. Waves of emotion surged in his heart, and he had to admit that he had underestimated Long Nanzi’s courage. Only at this moment did he recall some of Long Nanzi’s past achievements!

Perhaps it was because Wang Baole hadn’t shown his vengeful and ruthless nature too much after stepping into the Spirit Immortal realm that Zhang Tian had forgotten about his past!

When Wang Baole was still in the Soul Conduit realm, because he suffered a loss from the New Dao Sect’s Black Dragon Legion, he slaughtered the Legion Commander’s disciple. After that, he escaped from the Black Dragon Legion’s pursuit and eventually returned to destroy it completely, thus gaining the title of madman!

“Madman!”

A madman was someone who didn’t care whether he lived or died and only sought his own pleasure. Even if he had to sacrifice a thousand portions of his life, he would still take eight hundred of yours!

A madman was a lunatic who dared to snatch food from the mouth of an almighty Eternal Star realm cultivator! But… he had still succeeded!

As he watched the retreating figure of Wang Baole on the boat, the other party’s feats of madness surfaced in Zhang Tian’s mind. He suddenly felt a surge of regret. He regretted… that he had ever offended Long Nanzi!

While Zhang Tian felt immense regret and Daoist Lin Hai struggled with his dilemma, the figure of the spirit boat grew increasingly blurry until it completely disappeared from sight. It sped through the starry sky at an indescribable speed, as if it was directly warping through the void.

As Wang Baole stood on the boat and looked outside, the starry sky seemed to have turned into a river flowing before his eyes. This feeling made Wang Baole realize that the boat’s speed had reached a horrifying level. At the same time, he heaved a huge sigh of relief.

After all, the fact that the paper human cutout didn’t kick him off the boat meant that his plan was a perfect success. Obtaining a paper quota card really did qualify him to enter the Starfall Realm.

Once that thought flashed through his mind, Wang Baole finally relaxed completely. He withdrew his gaze from the starry sky outside and instead looked at the nearly fifty Heavenly Chosen all around him.

These people were a mix of both male and female, and they all meditated a certain distance away from each other. Clearly, with their statuses, they were unwilling to get too close to others. Besides the few people who had quarreled with Wang Baole previously and now sported gloomy expressions, the others all had different looks on their faces.

Some were surprised, some were curious, and some weren’t interested in him at all.

“Hi there, we meet again.” Wang Baole felt that it was necessary for him to establish a good relationship with these prodigies, so he blinked and greeted them.

But most of them ignored him, and some of them even snorted coldly in response. Obviously, although they recognized his strength, the way he had boarded the boat seemed to violate some taboo, making everyone dislike him.

‘Thankless wretches. I shouldn’t have helped them row the boat back then.’ Wang Baole snorted in his heart. You ignore me and I ignore you, he thought to himself.

With that thought, Wang Baole didn’t bother to continue trying to build a relationship with them. He could tell that these people were all quite arrogant, but he also had to admit that the Heavenly Chosen on board did indeed have the right to be so.

None of them were weaker than the Heavenly Chosen of the Violet Gold civilization, and there were even a few who were stronger. Although they were all in the great circle of the Spirit Immortal realm, their varied backgrounds and differing talents made their actual combat power very different.

There was one person in the crowd who caught Wang Baole’s attention in particular. It was a woman who wore a mask on her face. Wang Baole couldn’t see her true appearance, only that mask that had the face of a beautiful and cold woman carved on it.

Wang Baole had only taken a few glances before the woman seemed to have noticed something. She turned to look at Wang Baole as well, and her gaze was utterly emotionless, as if she was looking at a corpse. However, this gaze didn’t have much of an effect on Wang Baole. His expression remained the same as ever, and he even gave her a smile.

The woman’s eyes flickered before she stopped paying Wang Baole any attention.

Wang Baole raised his eyebrows. He was someone who had always believed that he was the most handsome man in the entire Federation. Now, he had smiled at the woman, but she actually ignored him. He snorted inwardly.

“Those who wear beautiful masks are usually ugly.”

After muttering a few words in his heart, Wang Baole found an empty space and sat down. He thought about the pros and cons of this trip and what he would do after arriving at the Starfall Realm, as well as how he could use his relationship with the paper human cutout in his storage ring to obtain an opportunity.

“An opportunity like advancing to the Planet Realm!” Wang Baole narrowed his eyes and showed intense anticipation.

Just like that, time passed slowly, and the spirit boat didn’t stop. It seemed that Wang Baole was the last person to board the boat. But after meditating for several days, he gradually became unable to sit still.

It was really too quiet. No one spoke or even moved, and they all meditated in silence while waiting for the end of the journey.

The first few days were fine, but after more than ten days passed, Wang Baole felt that continuing to meditate like this was too boring. Thus, as the others watched, he stood up and walked to the bow of the boat.

“Senior, you’ve worked hard. Let me help you row the boat. Do you remember from last time? I love rowing!”

The moment Wang Baole spoke, he immediately attracted the attention of all the prodigies. The Heavenly Chosen who had seen him rowing the boat before all had ugly expressions on their faces. Those who weren’t there before showed looks of surprise.

Thus, under the crowd’s watchful eyes, Wang Baole stood there and waited for a while. Seeing the paper human cutout ignore him, Wang Baole sighed. Although it was a little awkward to be stared at by everyone, the thickness of his skin was even more exaggerated than the might of his battle prowess. Thus, he coughed and cupped his fists, bowing deeply to the paper human cutout.

“Thank you for your guidance, Senior. Senior knows that Junior has to seek opportunities at the Starfall Realm and doesn’t want to tire me out ahead of time. Thank you again!” As he spoke, Wang Baole turned around and returned to the spot where he was meditating previously. He sat there solemnly as the others looked at him with strange expressions.

Ignoring the gazes of the prodigies around him, Wang Baole sat quietly for a moment before looking around again.

“It can’t be that only these few people are qualified to enter the Starfall Realm this time, right?” He had already secretly observed everyone over the past few days and made comparisons in his heart. Besides the masked woman, although the others were all beyond ordinary cultivators, he still felt that dealing with them wouldn’t be too difficult.

At the same time, he didn’t only observe the Heavenly Chosen but also the decorations and structures on the boat. What caught his attention the most was… the altar placed at the stern of the boat!

This altar seemed to be made of wood and it didn’t appear to have any extraordinary aspects. Atop the altar, there was a stick of incense that seemed to never burn out, and there was also a plate of seven red fruits.

‘Those fruits should be edible… they look pretty tasty…’ Wang Baole stared at the fruits, blinked, and instinctively rubbed his stomach.

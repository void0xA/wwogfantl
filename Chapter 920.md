# Chapter 920 - I Wish...

Wang Baole felt that it wasn't because he was gluttonous, but because the temptation of the red fruit was too great! It looked delicious even at first glance, so his appetite couldn't help but be aroused.

"It must be like this, otherwise, how could I have the desire to eat when I don't even have any real internal organs?" Wang Baole rubbed his stomach. When he looked at the red fruits, he felt that they were very hateful.

For this kind of hateful food, Wang Baole felt that he had to eat it because that was the greatest punishment for the food. Thinking of this, he immediately became energetic. However, Wang Baole also understood that these fruits were placed there so obviously, yet no one else had taken them for so many days. This was enough to show that there was a problem.

It was certain that this fruit cannot be obtained by the Heavenly Chosen on the boat. Presumably, there was a restriction, or maybe the paper human cutout rowing the boat would not allow it.

“If it’s because there’s a restriction, then I’ll just take the punishment at worst, and that’ll be that. But if it’s because the paper human cutout doesn’t allow it…” Wang Baole blinked. He felt that he and the paper human cutout had both rowed the boat together and even developed some friendship. In particular, the paper human cutout in his storage ring and the one rowing the boat must have some relation to each other and maybe even knew each other.

Thinking this way, Wang Baole gained some confidence. He thought that since the paper human cutout didn’t let him help with rowing again, it should at least let him eat some fruit. Thinking of this, Wang Baole immediately stood up from his meditative pose. This caught the attention of some of the Heavenly Chosen in the surroundings.

Wang Baole was undoubtedly considered to be special among them. It was nothing more than rowing the boat at first, but then with the help of the Starfall Emissary itself, he boarded the boat again and stole a spot in the quota right in front of everyone. So his every move was being watched closely, even by those who seemed not to be paying any attention.

In particular, although Li Linzi, Wang Yishan, and the others who had conflicts with him before looked disdainful on the surface, they were all jealous of Wang Baole in their hearts. Seeing Wang Baole stand up again at this moment, they all glanced over.

They saw Wang Baole get up and go… straight to the altar at the stern. Almost immediately, the people watching understood what Wang Baole was thinking.

"Is he going to eat the fruit?"

After understanding this point, these Heavenly Chosen did not immediately reveal any emotions but watched and waited. After all, Wang Baole's performance here earlier was outstanding, and it was obvious that the Starfall Emissary's attitude towards him was different from the others. Therefore, even if they felt that the possibility of getting to eat the fruit offerings was close to none, it was best not to make a quick judgment.

Wang Baole ignored the gazes of these people. His body flashed and quickly approached the stern. A moment later, he was about to step onto the altar, but the instant his body approached the altar, the paper human cutout suddenly raised its paddle. Wang Baole didn’t see how it cast the spell; all he saw were some ripples spreading out, and then his whole body trembled.

He felt a force strong enough to topple mountains and seas erupting from the altar and sweeping towards him. It enveloped him in an instant, and he didn’t even have time to dodge. He lost his footing and fell backward as if someone had shoved him. Even his cultivation base had become unstable at this moment, which made Wang Baole feel like his world was spinning.

Seeing this, many of the people watching sneered, although they felt relieved in their hearts. The Starfall Emissary’s previous attitude towards Wang Baole had aroused their envy, but now they saw that his current treatment was the same as theirs, filling their hearts with joy.

"There must be something wrong with this Xie Dalu's head. These fruits have always been placed there. If you could really take them away as you please, I would have done it long ago!"

"It seems that he’s just an idiot. The offering fruits on the Starfall Boat have been recorded in many ancient books. So far, only one person has successfully obtained one; the third prince of the Never Ending clan, who received one because of his peerless talent!"

Although everyone kept these thoughts in their minds, even if Li Linzi and the others said nothing, their looks of mockery and disdain became more and more obvious.

Li Linzi in particular felt like if he kept quiet, he would be missing an opportunity. With a mocking expression, he sneered.

"I didn't expect there to be such a fool. Xie Dalu, don’t you know that only one person has ever obtained the Spirit Fruit on the Starfall Boat since ancient times? Did you really think you would be the second one?"

As soon as these words came out, Wang Yishan and the rest also burst into laughter one after another.

Listening to their laughter and seeing the expressions of other people around, Wang Baole, whose cultivation base had slowly become stable, was somewhat tired and angry at the same time. His eyes widened to a glare and he snorted, thinking, ‘This Daddy doesn’t believe I can’t do it!’ He sat there and pushed his right hand into his storage bag, covertly taking out the wishing bottle.

At this point, he didn't care about the side effects of the wishing bottle anymore. Even if there was lightning tribulation, there was still the spirit boat to resist it. Thinking of this, he silently made a wish in his heart.

"I want that fruit!"

The bottle gave no response.

"I want to enter the altar!"

The bottle still didn't respond, making Wang Baole sigh in his heart. Feeling more and more disappointed with the wishing bottle, he thought about it for a bit and silently tried to wish again.

"I wish that the paper human cutout on this boat will not try to stop me!"

When he said these words in his mind, Wang Baole's body shook violently. He felt some heat flow from the wishing bottle at this moment. He couldn't help being nervous and excited, and his breathing also hastened slightly. He was just trying to make some wishes out of anger and didn't think he would be successful on the third try.

As he sat there and looked at the paper human who was still rowing, Wang Baole blinked and thought for a while before gritting his teeth fiercely. After putting away the wishing bottle, under the gazes of everyone around him, he stood up again.

"Are you still going to try again? Xie Dalu, I admire your courage, come on!" Li Linzi cast a glance at Wang Baole and sneered.

"Li Linzi, carefully watch your Daddy!" Wang Baole’s temperament wasn’t one that allowed him to suffer losses to begin with. Therefore, when he heard Li Linzi's repeated ridicule, he looked over and spoke indifferently with a cold gleam in his eyes.

This cold gleam caused Li Linzi to narrow his eyes, and the eyes of his companions around him also brightened maliciously. If Wang Baole really made a move here, they definitely wouldn’t sit idly by.

Glancing coldly at Li Linzi and the others, Wang Baole snorted and walked straight to the altar. His speed was the same as last time, instantly reaching the altar after a few steps. When he got this far last time, the paper human cutout drove him away.

Looking at this scene, Li Linzi and his group had a sneer on their lips. The other Heavenly Chosen also looked over lightly with more or less disdainful expressions. Obviously, everyone believed that eating the Spirit Fruit was not something just anyone could do.

But as soon as they revealed these expressions, Wang Baole jumped and landed directly beside the altar!

The paper human cutout didn't stop him this time, continuing to row as if it hadn't noticed Wang Baole's actions at all.

This caused everyone’s gazes to instantly turn towards Wang Baole, their minds buzzing. Even the masked woman opened her eyes in surprise.

Stormy waves of shock raged in everyone’s mind. Stunned, they watched helplessly as Wang Baole reached the altar, raised his hand to pick up one of the fruits, and put it to his mouth. He took a bite... and directly ate half of it!

Wang Baole was very happy right now and felt that his wishing bottle was still very useful after all. Sure enough, his wish came true and the paper human cutout didn't come to stop him. After he put the fruit into his mouth, its fragrance immediately burst out, and it immediately dissolved into liquid akin to fine wine. It spread through his whole body, bringing a feeling of pleasure and comfort. This made Wang Baole quickly take a few more bites. He swallowed the entire fruit, even the core, and let out a burp before turning to look at the surrounding Heavenly Chosen, whose eyeballs seemed to be about to drop out of their sockets.

"The flavor's not ba--huh?"

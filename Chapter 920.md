# Chapter 920 - Making a Wish

Wang Baole felt that it wasn’t because he was gluttonous, but because the temptation of the red fruit was too great! It looked delicious even at first glance, so his appetite couldn’t help but be aroused.

“It must be like this, otherwise, how could I have the desire to eat when I don’t even have any real internal organs?” Wang Baole rubbed his stomach, and when he looked at the red fruits, he felt that they were very hateful.

For this kind of hateful food, Wang Baole felt that he had to eat it because that was the greatest punishment for the food. Thinking of this, he immediately became energetic. However, Wang Baole also understood that these fruits were placed there so obviously, yet no one else had taken them for so many days. This was enough to show that there was a problem.

It was certain that this fruit cannot be obtained by the Heavenly Chosen on the boat. Presumably, there was a restriction, or maybe the paper human cutout rowing the boat would not allow it.

“It’s fine if there’s a restriction, I’ll suffer a penalty at worst, but if the paper human cutout doesn’t allow it…” Wang Baole blinked. He felt that he and the paper human cutout had both rowed the boat together and even developed some friendship. In particular, the paper human cutout in his storage ring and the one rowing the boat must have some relation. They might even know each other.

Thinking this way, Wang Baole gained some confidence. He thought that instead of letting him help with rowing again, it would be okay to let him eat some fruit. Thinking of this, Wang Baole immediately stood up from his meditative pose. This caught the attention of some of the Heavenly Chosen around.

Wang Baole was undoubtedly considered to be special among them. It was nothing more than rowing the boat at first, but then with the help of the Starfall Emissary itself, he boarded the boat again to plunder a spot in the quota right in front of everyone. So his every move was being watched closely, even by those who seemed not to be paying any attention.

Especially Li Linzi, Wang Yishan, and others who had conflicts with him before. Although they looked disdainful on the surface, they were all jealous of Wang Baole in their hearts. Seeing Wang Baole stand up again at this moment, they all glanced over.

They saw Wang Baole get up and go… straight to the altar at the stern. Almost immediately, they understood what Wang Baole was about to do.

“Is he going to eat the fruit?”

After understanding this point, these Heavenly Chosen did not immediately reveal any emotions but waited and watched. After all, Wang Baole’s performance here earlier was outstanding, and it was obvious that the Starfall Emissary’s attitude towards him was different from the others. Therefore, even if they felt that the possibility of getting to eat the offering fruit was close to none, it was best not to make a quick judgment.

Wang Baole ignored the gazes of these people. His body flashed and he approached the stern quickly. After a moment, he was about to step onto the altar, but the instant his body approached the altar, the paper human cutout suddenly raised its paddle. Wang Baole didn’t see how it cast the spell, he only saw some ripples spread out, and then his whole body started to tremble.

He felt a force, strong enough to topple mountains and seas, erupting from the altar and sweeping towards him. He was enveloped in an instant, not even having the time to dodge. He lost his footing and fell backward as if he had been pushed by someone. Even his cultivation base had become unstable at this moment, which made Wang Baole feel like his entire world was spinning.

Seeing this, many of the people watching sneered, although they felt relieved in their hearts. The Starfall Emissary’s previous attitude towards Wang Baole had aroused their envy, but now they saw that his current treatment was pretty much the same as theirs, filling their hearts with joy.

“There must be something wrong with Xie Dalu’s head. These fruits have always been placed there. If you could really take them away as you please, I would have done it long ago!”

“It seems that he is just an idiot. The offering fruits on the Starfall Boat have been recorded in many ancient books. So far, only one person has successfully obtained one; the third prince of the Never Ending clan, who received one because of his peerless talent!”

Although everyone kept these thoughts in their minds, even if Li Linzi and the others said nothing, their looks of mockery and disdain became more and more obvious.

Li Linzi especially felt like he shouldn’t miss such an opportunity by keeping quiet, so he kept up his ridiculing expression and sneered.

“I didn’t expect there to be such a fool. Don’t you know, Xie Dalu, that only one person has ever obtained the Spirit Fruit on the Starfall Boat since ancient times? Did you really think you would be the second one?”

As soon as these words came out, Wang Yishan and the rest also burst into laughter one after another.

Listening to their laughter and seeing the expressions of other people around, Wang Baole, whose cultivation base had slowly become stable, was somewhat tired and angry at the same time. His eyes widened to a glare as he thought, ‘This daddy won’t believe he can’t do it.’ Wang Baole snorted. He sat there and pushed his right hand into his storage bag, covertly taking out the wishing bottle.

At this point, he didn’t care about the side effects of the wishing bottle anymore. Even if there was lightning tribulation, there was still this spirit boat to resist it. Thinking of this, he silently made a wish in his heart.

“I want that fruit!”

The bottle gave no response.

“I want to enter the altar!”

The bottle still didn’t respond, making Wang Baole sigh in his heart. Feeling more and more disappointed with the wishing bottle, he thought about it for a bit and silently tried to wish again.

“I wish the paper human cutout on this boat will not try to stop me!”

When he said these words in his mind, Wang Baole’s body shook violently. He felt some heat flow from the wishing bottle at this moment. He couldn’t help being nervous and excited, and his breath was cut short. He was just trying to make some wishes out of anger, but he didn’t think he would be successful on the third try.

As he sat there and looked at the paper human who was still rowing, Wang Baole blinked, thought for a while, and gritted his teeth fiercely. After putting away the wishing bottle, under the looks of everyone around him, he stood up again.

“Are you still going to try again? Xie Dalu, I admire your courage, come on!” Li Linzi cast a glance at Wang Baole and sneered.

“Li Linzi, carefully watch your Daddy!” Wang Baole’s temperament didn’t allow him to suffer losses. Therefore when he heard Li Linzi’s repeated ridicule, he looked over and said this indifferently, with a cold gleam in his eyes.

This cold gleam caused Li Linzi to narrow his eyes, and the eyes of his companions around him also brightened maliciously. If Wang Baole really made a move here, they would definitely not sit by idly.

Glancing coldly at Li Linzi and the others, Wang Baole snorted and walked straight to the altar. His speed was the same as last time. He took a few steps and instantly reached the altar. The last time he had reached this spot, he was driven away by the paper human cutout.

Looking at this scene, Li Linzi and his group had a sneer on their lips. The other Heavenly Chosen also looked at it lightly, with a more or less disdainful expression. Obviously, everyone believed that eating the Spirit Fruit was not something just anyone could do.

But as soon as they revealed these expressions, Wang Baole jumped and landed directly beside the altar!

The paper human cutout didn’t stop him this time and continued rowing as if it hadn’t noticed Wang Baole’s actions at all.

This caused the eyes of everyone around to turn toward Wang Baole instantly, and their minds buzzed. Even the masked woman opened her eyes which revealed her surprise.

Stormy waves of shock raged in everyone’s mind. They were stunned, watching helplessly as Wang Baole reached the altar, raised his hand to pick up one of the fruits on it, and put it to his mouth. He took a bite… and directly ate half of it!

Wang Baole was very happy now. He felt that his wishing bottle was still very useful. Sure enough, the wish came true and the paper human cutout didn’t come to stop him. After he ate the fruit, his mouth was full of its fragrance, and it instantly liquified, akin to a fine wine. It spread throughout his body, bringing a feeling of pleasure and comfort. This made Wang Baole quickly eat a few more mouthfuls. He swallowed the entire fruit, even the core, and let out a burp. He then turned to look at the Heavenly Chosen whose eyeballs seemed to be about to pop out of their sockets.

“The taste is not…huh?”

# Chapter 927 - Seizing a Precious Opportunity!

As soon as Wang Baole’s proud words came out, hundreds of red lightning bolts crashed down on the Starfall Boat, causing the paper black sea’s resentment to recede rapidly, allowing more of the boat’s true appearance to be exposed.

It wasn’t over yet, however. In the next moment, thunder rumbled as more bolts of lightning arrived. These lightning bolts seemed to be intelligent and didn’t look for other people. Even if they passed by those Chosen in mid-air, the lightning didn’t hurt them at all, yet all of them landed accurately on the boat…

The white paper of the boat was rapidly recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye. Wang Baole felt excited at that moment. He felt both sorrow and joy, so he raised his head and roared toward the heavens.

"Today, this Xie wants to completely wipe out this Black Sea. Devil Dao Lightning, eradicate it! Come, come!"

As soon as his words came out, more lightning bolts crashed down, covering the entire boat, which caused the black sea’s resentment on the boat to disappear in an instant. It even affected some surrounding areas outside the boat. Gradually, the black faded and became white!

Although more resentment frantically gathered from all around, a balance was eventually reached. The boat Wang Baole was on had completely recovered at this moment. The paper human cutout on the boat had a strange light in its eyes as it moved the paddle and cruised into the distance.

It was obvious that the Starfall Realm was affecting the scale of the lightning tribulation. It was not as frightening as the civilization-sized sea of lightning from before. Here, it only covered the range of one Starfall Boat.

Even so, this scene still made the seven or eight people who stayed on the boat shocked and ecstatic, and it also caused the breathing of the other Chosen outside to quicken one by one.

“What kind of lightning is this? One minute it’s the Divine Might Dao Lightning, and the other minute it’s Devil Dao Lightning!”

“No matter what it is, it seems to be able to purify the black sea’s resentment!”

Except for the ones who had already flown far away, all the Chosen in a certain range saw this scene and were shocked to the extreme. In fact, the other eight Starfall Boats had already been mostly corrupted by the black paper sea, with the most serious case being over ninety percent corrupted. It was almost like the boats were merging with the black paper sea.

The boats clearly couldn’t hold on for long, which made some of the cultivators who came to the Starfall Realm this time very anxious.

Although there were not many people in this group, there were still about one hundred. Under the pressure of the heavens, they knew that it was impossible for them to reach the shore, even if they flew with all their might. Although they could slow down their speed while flying, they wouldn’t be able to reach the shore in five days and would definitely be ousted from the Starfall Realm.

Everyone was worried and depressed at first, but after seeing Wang Baole’s boat recover from the lightning, they felt hope and their eyes instantly showed a strong light.

Obviously…If they could step foot on that boat, they might have a chance of reaching the shore within five days!

They weren’t the only ones who had that idea. Even those who were confident in their ability to reach the shore knew that it would be better to ride the boat instead.

Soon, someone rushed out in mid-air and made a beeline for Wang Baole’s boat. Behind him, there were more cultivators who turned into long streaks of light and wanted to board the boat by force!

If someone stopped them, that person would become the entire group’s enemy. The people inside Wang Baole’s boat looked at him in warning.

Seeing this, Wang Baole felt tired in his heart. He secretly sighed; his thoughts before this point were selling the soul fruits, and he knew these Chosen were insanely rich. They could take out millions of Red Crystals casually, yet it was unlikely for him to be able to sell anything now. Wang Baole felt depressed.

“It would be great if I could sell boat tickets…” Wang Baole felt regretful but he knew he could only dream. If he forcefully stopped everyone, it would be the same as provoking public outrage…

The feeling of knowing there was money to be made but being unable to make it caused Wang Baole to feel dejected. All he could do was sigh in regret. However, just as he sighed, something happened. The Chosen who had first rushed towards the boat stopped for an instant, feeling intimidated by the veil of red lightning surrounding the ship, but quickly realized that it wasn’t targeting him and rushed to board the ship.

But at that moment…the paper human cutout at the bow of the boat raised its left hand and waved it casually. The young man that was about to board the boat let out a scream, as if being slapped by an invisible palm, and coughed up a mouthful of blood before his body suddenly rolled back at a high speed.

This scene made Wang Baole’s eyes widen, and it made the other Chosen’s minds shake wildly. However, the ones approaching the boat showed a fierce light in their eyes and still tried to forcefully enter the boat.

In an instant, dozens of people went through the red lightning veil and tried to board the boat; however, the paper human cutout just raised its left hand and waved it slightly before screams continuously rang out. The bodies of the Chosen were slapped away and they coughed up blood one after another! However, there were some people who weren’t slapped away!

Among these people was Li Linzi, who was visibly excited at this moment. His face couldn’t hide his excitement when he landed on the boat. He didn’t care about Wang Baole’s gaze and quickly found a corner and sat down cross-legged to meditate with an expression of never wanting to leave again.

Seeing that some people succeeded, the hundred or so Chosen became red-eyed, rushing one after another toward the boat. Although most were knocked away by the paper human cutout, it seemed that there were seven or eight cultivators who were lucky, as the paper human cutout did nothing to stop them.

It was also at this moment that Wang Baole started seeing a pattern. The ones that boarded the boat and the Chosen outside of it saw this pattern as well.

“The people who boarded…are the people who were previously on the ship before!”

“Is this the rule of the Starfall Boat? Cultivators from other boats can not step onto a different one?”

This scene made the Chosen in the sky very sad and indignant, but they were helpless. They couldn’t even blame Wang Baole. After all…he wasn’t the one stopping them.

But since it was related to the Starfall Realm’s assessment, they still needed to try. There were a few cultivators who didn’t give up and continued rushing toward the Starfall Boat.

Wang Baole’s eyes lit up, and his mind began to spin rapidly. 

“Since the lightning chased me here, I’m not sure whether or not the wish is still in effect…my original wish stated that the paper human cutout shall not stop my actions!”

“If it’s really still effective, does it mean that if I allow people in myself, the paper human cutout won’t stop them?” Thinking of this, Wang Baole’s heart skipped a beat. Seeing this batch of cultivators, and the paper human cutout’s left hand, Wang Baole suddenly let out a roar.

“Little Fatty, don’t fight back! I’ll bring you in!” As he spoke, Wang Baole raised his right hand and grabbed a little fatty from among the two closest cultivators trying to board the boat!

The little fatty’s body was shaped like a ball. The reason Wang Baole chose this person was that on one hand, he thought that the other person’s stature was similar to his, and on the other hand, he looked very rich.

The little fatty’s reaction was also extremely fast. Seeing himself being dragged by the other party, he didn’t resist. He allowed Wang Baole to pull him in and was completely ignored by the paper human cutout. He was successfully dragged onto the boat.

As soon as he got onto the boat, the little fatty couldn’t believe what had happened. After regaining his wits, he laughed heartily. The fat on his face started jiggling up and down, and he clasped his fists toward Wang Baole.

“Thank you, Fellow Daoist.”

As for the others, they didn’t receive this kind of treatment. They were all forced to retreat under the paper human cutout’s hand waves. The scene in front of them caused their breathing to hasten. Their eyes widened as they looked at Wang Baole.

Wang Baole felt very excited in his heart, but feeling that the little fatty didn’t seem to be sincere enough in his thanks, he glared at the fatty and spoke. 

“Save your thanks. One hundred thousand Red Crystals.”

“A hundred thousand Red Crystals?” The little fatty’s eyes widened, and his gratitude disappeared instantly as he glared at Wang Baole.

“You’re too sinister! Why don’t you just rob me? I, Zhou Linfeng, have never been ripped off before. You want me to give you money? Won’t happen!”

“You won’t give it?” Wang Baole was also angry, thinking to himself that the price was very fair. Not asking for a million Red Crystals was already benevolent of him, but the other party actually bit the hand that fed him.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">[1]</a></sup>

So when he glared at the fatty, he felt that the other party should know the value of seizing a precious opportunity!<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">[2]</a></sup> Therefore, he turned around and stared at the other Chosen outside the boat.

“One hundred thousand Red Crystals to board the boat. Which one of you agrees? I’ll bring you in to replace this Little Fatty!”

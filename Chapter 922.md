# Chapter 922 - The Lightning Persists!

Just as Wang Baole was calculating and feeling extremely regretful about the loss of fifteen million Red Crystals, the eyes of the other Chosen on the boat flickered. Immediately, others began to speak up.
 
“Fellow Daoist Xie, I’m also willing to spend three million Red Crystals to buy a Soul Spirit Fruit!

“Fellow Daoist Dalu, I offer three million and five hundred thousand. The first fruit is indeed the only one that is fully effective, and the rest are almost useless. Besides, you’ve already eaten a lot, so sell it to me!

“Four million. Fellow Daoist Xie, the price I’m giving is already astronomical. Although I don’t have enough Red Crystals on me, I can use Dharmic Armaments as collateral!”

They spoke one after another, which made Wang Baole feel even more regretful. After sighing, Wang Baole slowly narrowed his eyes. Even though someone had placed a bid of four million, Wang Baole felt that the masked woman remained as cold as ever. However, she did not ridicule him or hide anything from him. This gave him a good impression of her. At the same time, he also knew that whether it was on this boat or in the Starfall Realm that they were heading to, his own power was still a little weak.

“Four million and three million are already both huge amounts of wealth to me. There’s no need to be greedy…” With that thought, a strange glow appeared in Wang Baole’s eyes. With a wave of his right hand, he instantly swept up the only remaining Soul Spirit Fruit on the altar and threw it toward the masked woman. To prevent any misunderstandings, he spoke at the same time.

“There must be a first-come-first-serve basis for handling these matters. I’m from the Xie family, and I have principles!”

The moment Wang Baole took out the Soul Spirit Fruit and said those words, the masked woman’s body turned blurry. Not waiting for others to fight for it, she reappeared outside the altar. She raised her right hand and grabbed the Soul Spirit Fruit that Wang Baole had thrown at her.

While holding the fruit, the masked woman raised her head and gave Wang Baole a deep look. The coldness in her eyes eased considerably. After nodding slightly, she ignored the greedy gazes of the Chosen around her and returned to the spot where she had been meditatingbefore swallowing the fruit in one gulp.

“Everyone, I took a bite out of the fruit in my hand, and its skin is a little torn…If you don’t mind, I’ll auction the last fruit off. It’ll go to the highest bidder!” Wang Baole coughed, attracting everyone’s attention. He then raised the Soul Spirit Fruit with tooth marks on it and spoke with anticipation.

Looking at the Soul Spirit Fruit in his hand, even though there were obvious tooth marks on it, all the Chosen had a fire in their eyes. After a short silence, the sound of rapid bidding rang out.

The price rose at a rapid pace, going from three million to five million almost instantly. Wang Baole was frightened by the sight. The sudden forbearing of this huge amount of wealth caught him by surprise.

However, this did not mean that the Chosen were foolish rich sheep. In fact, to they who were carefully selected from their respective families and factions, being able to obtain the qualification to enter the Starfall Realm meant that high hopes were being placed on them. As long as they didn’t squander their wealth heedlessly, this kind of expenditure was perfectly acceptable. 

To them, as long as the opportunity and treasures that they could buy were useful to them, it would be worth it no matter the price. This is especially so for the Soul Spirit Fruit, which could not only increase their chance of breaking through to the Planet realm but can also improve the possibility of fusing with Special Planets.

Just like that, after stiff competition, the one to get the fruit was actually Li Linzi. The price he offered was so high that it almost seemed like a joke.

“Nine million!!!” Li Linzi roared, eyes red. He was afraid Wang Baole wouldn’t sell it to him, so he simply offered this obscene price.

After hearing the price, the other Chosen couldn’t help but gasp while hesitating. After a moment, they fell silent.

As he saw this, Wang Baole’s eyes lit up. In reality, Li Linzi was thinking too much. Wang Baole would’ve given him the fruit even if he gave a normal price. At this price, however, Wang Baole was moved beyond words.

“These people are truly rich!” Wang Baole was suddenly energetic. He realized that maybe his good fortune on this trip lay not in the Starfall Realm, but…here on this boat!

As that thought brushed through his head, Wang Baole was about to nod when he saw that no one else was talking. He believed himself to be a person of status, so he coughed and acted nonchalantly as if gold was dirt to him.

“Since there are no more bids…I guess I’ll sell it to you.”

Li Linzi was simultaneously nervous and excited while still feeling a bit aggrieved from earlier. However, he suppressed his true feelings and quickly gave Wang Baole three Red Crystal cards, completing the deal.

When he got the Soul Spirit Fruit, he ignored the large tooth mark and swallowed it in one gulp. Li Linzi then sat down cross-legged and immediately began meditating. Although some people said earlier that Wang Baole was wasting heavenly treasures,  they were mainly just jealous. In fact, for any of them, they wouldn’t have the patience to wait until they could return and refine it into a pill. After all, only once it was in your own stomach would it truly belong to you.
Wang Baole earned twelve million Red Crystals quite easily, which made him dizzy. Even in his dreams, he could never imagine holding such wealth. There was a feverish look in his eyes.

“I’m going to the Xie family’s market and buying twenty Nine Heavenly Thunder Spirits!”

“I’ll buy three gallons<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup> of Cloud Sky River water!”

“I also want to buy that Heaven and Earth Spirit Boat that is worth several million!!”

At that thought, while he was excited, he suddenly felt that twelve million was not that much…So after quickly looking around the area and finding nothing else to sell, he scanned the altar carefully.

“No more…” After confirming there were indeed no more items on the altar that he could sell, Wang Baole sighed in regret and prepared to leave the altar. At this moment, however, Wang Baole saw a familiar bright glow appear suddenly, traveling at the same speed as the spirit boat. It was as if an oil painting had materialized in the starry sky.

“This is…” Wang Baole’s eyes widened in an instant as the ray of light became dazzling, roaring toward the Starfall Boat.

Its speed was so fast that by the time everyone noticed it, the light was already approaching. It turned into a lightning bolt with a thickness of 30 feet<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">2</a></sup>, blasting toward the spirit boat!

Immediately, a deafening noise rumbled. Although the boat was unharmed, it shocked everyone on board. Along with the other Chosen, even the masked woman opened her eyes with vigilance.

“Enemy attack?”

“How could lightning appear out of nowhere?!”

“This lightning is already comparable to a heavenly tribulation!!”

While everyone was startled at the scene, they didn’t notice that although Wang Baole also had a shocked expression, deep inside he felt a tinge of guilt.

The others didn’t know why the lightning had come, but Wang Baole knew. This was the side effect of the wishing bottle, and it was obviously even more terrifying than before. The spirit boat was traveling at a terrifying speed, yet the lightning still caught up easily. 

Its huge size made Wang Baole incredibly nervous. According to his previous experience, there were likely to be many more of these coming.

“I believe this Starfall Boat can resist it!” Wang Baole hurriedly comforted himself. He was worried about his expression being noticed, so he immediately made his expression identical to the other Chosen on the boat. However…almost immediately after he comforted himself, a second lightning bolt sped toward the boat, along with a third, fourth, and fifth…

In just a few breaths, the number of lights that appeared in the surrounding starry sky reached the dozens. In the next moment, it skyrocketed to hundreds of lightning bolts that rumbled toward the spirit boat.

Everyone on the boat was shell-shocked, except for the paper human cutout rowing the boat. Its expression and movements remained perfectly normal, seemingly just allowing the hundreds of lightning bolts to fall upon the boat. After all, the spirit boat wasn’t too affected by them, only trembling slightly.

This made Wang Baole heave a huge sigh of relief, and his heart filled with arrogance. He secretly thought that this Daddy was smart, and with the invincible Starfall Boat, no matter how powerful the side effects of the Wishing Bottle were, they would be helpless in front of it. 

It wasn’t known if his thoughts angered the lightning, but in the next moment, the starry sky brightened many folds. If one could look down at an astonishing height, one could see a sea of lightning comparable in size to that of an entire civilization be formed! 

The countless lightning bolts turned scarlet in color, and like a sea of ferocious snakes, leaped toward the spirit boat from all directions, with enough power to topple mountains and overturn seas!<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3">3</a></sup>

All the Chosen on the boat, including Wang Baole, had a drastic change in expression. Even the usually expressionless paper human cutout who rowed the boat twitched, and the oar in its hand couldn’t help but pause for a moment.

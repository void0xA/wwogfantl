# Chapter 929 - Outer Realm Thunder Intent!

Just like that, transactions of one hundred thousand Red Crystals were carried out one after another by the Chosen in mid-air. It’s not that they didn’t think about backing out, but once they backed out, they would face Wang Baole and the others’ dissatisfaction. 

By then, for the sake of a mere one hundred thousand Red Crystals, they would have offended Wang Baole and the other Chosen who wanted to board the ship. As long as one isn’t foolish, one wouldn’t do such a thing.

After all, although one hundred thousand Red Crystals was not a small sum, to them, it was far from a grievous blow<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">[1]</a></sup>. However, when they gloomily boarded the ship, they nonetheless looked at Wang Baole with disgust. Cursing, they vowed that they would never be ripped off like this a second time.

If not for the fact that this place was dangerous and the paper human cutout was obviously biased towards Wang Baole, striking fear into everyone’s hearts, they would have attacked Wang Baole already. Wang Baole clearly knew their thoughts, but he didn’t care at all.

‘Chosen? Just a group of clay chickens and pottery dogs<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">[2]</a></sup> stuffed with resources!’ Wang Baole snorted coldly in his heart, but on the surface, his expression didn’t change in the slightest. Instead, he smiled and laughed, not insisting on the previous limit he had mentioned. All of the people outside who wanted to come in were pulled in.

After easily earning ten million Red Crystals, Wang Baole patted his storage bag and felt refreshed. Looking around at the Black Paper Sea, he felt that there was something special about it.

“Thank you Fellow Daoists for your support. Don’t feel aggrieved, as both of us benefit from this transaction! I, Xie Dalu, do reliable business and promise to send you ashore safely!” Wang Baole said while waving his hand. The boat then suddenly roared and galloped towards the distance as lightning kept falling all around it.

Behind it, the other Starfall Boats were submerged by the black sea one after another and eventually disappeared. In the entire Black Paper Sea, only Wang Baole’s Starfall Boat was seen. There was a whistling sound as it braved the winds and the billows<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3">[3]</a></sup>.

Just like that, after the Starfall Boat sped along for four days straight, the vague outline of the shore could be seen in the distance…the original five days were shortened due to the speed of the spirit boat. Everyone who paid to board the ship felt better as a result.

In addition, what really made their hearts joyful was that during the four-day journey, they saw those who relied on their own abilities to cross the sea work tremendously hard, and even saw someone fall into the Black Paper Sea and become a paper human cutout. Everyone suddenly felt that one hundred thousand Red Crystals did not seem expensive at all…

The only thing that was uncomfortable….was that there were more and more people on the boat…In fact, when the Chosen, tired from flying, saw the boat and looked at the calm and relaxed people on it, how could they not take this opportunity? Therefore, under Wang Baole’s shouts, they would spend money to buy spots for themselves.

Just like that, the number of people on board continued to increase, and in the end there was no room to sit in the cabin. Some people aboard the boat were strong enough that if they wanted to have their own place to meditate, they could just take it by force. So…as the number of people on the boat increased, the weaker cultivators could only stand on other positions like sails and poles.

If one stood on the shore and looked at the boat from a distance, they would see that it was densely packed with over 300 people, giving off an astonishing presence. Those proud Chosen waiting on the shore could only look dull in comparison.

“This…”

“This ship is not submerged?”

“So it’s possible to do this…”

Hundreds of Chosen were standing on the shore, including the four masked people. These people were all those who crossed the Paper Black Sea using their own strength. The difference was only in the length of time. The four masked people only used two and a half days to reach the shore. After them, Chosen came one after another. After arriving, they were extremely exhausted. Therefore, after seeing the Starfall Boat where Wang Baole was, they were inevitably shocked.

Along with the shocked cultivators, there were some strange cultivators on the shore. They were…all paper human cutouts. Unlike the black in the Black Paper Sea, these paper human cutouts were all white. They were densely packed with their numbers in the thousands. After they saw the Starfall Boat, their eyes widened and their expressions became strange.

In the many times that the Starfall Realm had opened, such a scene had obviously never appeared. Especially this moment, with lightning still wrapping around the boat. This made the boat look even more majestic.

When the people on the shore saw the boat, the cultivators on the boat naturally also saw the shore. Wang Baole sat at the ship’s bow. He occupied a large area by himself, so he was the first to see the shore. He immediately felt a difference in this world.

Looking at the shore, apart from the Chosen and the paper human cutouts, there were mountains in the distance with vegetation and buildings all around them. But…without exception, no matter whether it was the mountains in the distance, the buildings, or the plants and trees, it was all made of blank, white paper!

Except for the sky and the earth, everything that could be seen was paper. This scene made Wang Baoile squint his eyes, and at the same time, he saw the paper human cutouts on the shore. Any one of them exuded an aura that was not weaker than that of the paper human cutout rowing the boat, especially the dozen at the front. Their auras were so powerful that it made Wang Baole’s heart skip a beat.

Moreover, there was one in the middle that had a red line between its brows. When Wang Baole glanced at this paper human cutout, its aura made his mind roar like thunder.

“The ones at the front are Star Domain? And the rest of them are Eternal Star? And the one with the red line…seems to be stronger…it can’t be…” The strength showed made Wang Baole’s forehead start to sweat. The paper human cutout with the red line on its forehead had strength similar to the Flame Patriarch and his Senior Brother.

“The little young miss inside the mask once said the Senior Brother killed a God Sovereign…then his minimum cultivation level should be the great circle of Star Domain, and it’s possible that it surpasses that!”

“Although the Flame Patriarch’s aura was a little weaker than that of Senior Brother, it was similar…and the paper human cutout with the red line is also like this…then its cultivation level, could it be that it is also an existence far beyond Star Domain? Has it reached the level of the God Sovereigns of the Never-Ending Clan?

Wang Baole’s mind was spinning rapidly. The scene also made the other Chosen on the ship who knew a bit nervous and even more uneasy.

As everyone fell silent, the Starfall Boat was getting closer and closer to the shore, and when it was about to arrive, the lightning around the boat seemed to be inexplicably stimulated. It became more frequent all of a sudden. It was the first time that the lightning voluntarily left the range of the boat. It spread out as if wanting to reach the shore.

This made Wang Baole’s heart tremble, and when he was contemplating what to do, suddenly…the paper human cutout with a red line between his brows on the shore let out a cold snort.

“Outer Realm Thunder Intent?”

When those words came out, the paper human cutout raised its right hand and swung it toward the lightning. There was no cultivation power behind this swipe, but the next scene shocked Wang Baole and everyone on the boat in an instant.

The lightning bolts actually stopped at this moment, and at a speed visible to the naked eye, quickly turned into paper!

The lightning instantly turned into strips of white paper. The strips drifted down from mid-air, and sank into the surrounding Black Paper Sea!

“Turning lightning into paper?!” Wang Baole’s mind roared. The paper human cutout’s method was beyond his imagination. While he looked at the strips that sank into the Black Paper Sea, the Starfall Boat they were on finally reached the shore. With a roar, the boat halted.

Everyone, including Wang Baole, immediately flew out, not daring to show the slightest hint of arrogance. After stepping on land, they each cupped their fists and bowed deeply to the group of paper human cutouts.

Wang Baole was also in this crowd. He bowed his head a little guiltily and offered greetings along with the crowd. Although he didn’t raise his head, he faintly felt the gazes from some of the paper human cutouts. They seemed to be looking at him, but he wasn’t sure if he was just hallucinating.

“They know that the lightning was following me?” Wang Baole felt nervous, but fortunately, the gazes didn’t stay on him for too long before they withdrew. A dignified voice rang out.

“Seeds of the Never-Ending Dao Domain, welcome to the Starfall Empire!”

# Chapter 921 - Soul Spirit Fruit!

Before Wang Baole could finish speaking, his eyes widened in astonishment as his body started swaying. He had to hold onto the altar to prevent himself from falling, and his breathing grew unsteady. His vision blurred and his head became dizzy.

“Poison?!”

Wang Baole wailed inwardly. Suddenly, his whole body shook, and all of the dizziness converged onto his Divine Soul., causing rumbling sounds to spread within that couldn’t be heard by anyone but Wang Baole.

Amid the rumbling sounds, his Divine Soul swelled up as if it had received stimulation from a great tonic. In the blink of an eye, it erupted as if catalyzed by something.

Below the Planet realm, a cultivator’s Divine Soul was formless. It existed within the physical body, but its exact location couldn’t be determined. This was because it was everywhere. To a certain extent, the physical body was merely the carrier of the Divine Soul.

But now… after eating the fruit, with the eruption of his Divine Soul, Wang Baole felt something strange. It was as if… he could sense his Divine Soul. At the same time, his avatar… seemed to be unable to support the new strength of his Divine Soul!

This was because his soul had indeed been greatly nourished at this moment, causing it to almost break through in an instant. It was so huge that it exceeded the limits of his body.

It was a similar feeling to if he was wearing nice fitting clothes that suddenly shrunk instantaneously. That tight feeling made Wang Baole feel very uncomfortable. After a long while, he finally managed to stabilize himself. He stopped holding onto the altar and tried to lift his right hand…

But after he’d thought of lifting his hand, even though it lifted in an instant, Wang Baole felt like it was very slow. Soon, he realized that it wasn't that his body was slow but rather his Divine Soul was fast. His Divine Soul had grown stronger and in turn, vastly improved his reaction speed!

“This fruit… is good stuff!” After realizing this, Wang Baole immediately became wild with joy. In reality, he knew very well that although the Divine Soul didn’t seem to be related to the chances of a successful breakthrough into the Planet Realm, that was only because there weren’t many things in this world that could allow a Spirit Immortal realm cultivator’s soul to improve. In fact, the Divine Soul was closely related to the cultivation base’s ability to break through into the Planet Realm. It could be said that this fruit had increased his chances of breaking through by up to fifty percent. As for its other effects, Wang Baole wasn’t knowledgeable about medicine, so he didn’t know the details for now.

But it didn't matter. Someone immediately told him!

It was the masked woman!

“This fruit is called the Soul Spirit Fruit and only grows within the Starfall Realm. There are almost none in the outside world, but in the Never-Ending Dao Domain, this fruit is known as the number one item for helping a breakthrough from the Spirit Immortal Realm to the Planet Realm!”

“Although its main function is to enhance the Divine Soul, allowing it to reach the limit of the body, it also has another hidden function. That is… increasing the probability of fusing with Immortal Planets and even Special ones!

The masked woman spoke slowly. When Wang Baole heard her words, his entire body trembled., and he immediately picked up another fruit without hesitation. As for the others, although they clearly knew about the Soul Spirit Fruits, they were still shocked.

The reason for their shock wasn’t because of the words spoken by the masked woman. Instead, it was because they had recovered from their earlier shock. From their previous dumbfounded states, they immediately broke out into an uproar out of disbelief.

“How is this possible?!”

“He actually got it…Before this, only the third prince of the Never-Ending Clan succeeded. This fruit…Damn it, why didn’t the Starfall Envoy stop him!”

The previous silence of the boat now gave way to an uproar... The Heavenly Chosen all stood up and glared at Wang Baole with intense envy and madness in their eyes.

This was especially so when they saw Wang Baole pick up the second Soul Spirit Fruit and eat it right in front of them. They couldn’t control themselves and went crazy.

“What a waste…Xie Dalu, stop. Please stop eating it…”

“Xie Dalu, please stop! Don’t eat anymore!”

“One Soul Spirit Fruit is enough for one cultivator. It’s useless even if they eat more!” As the Heavenly Chosen surrounding him opened their mouths, Wang Baole noticed that the second fruit didn’t have much effect. Even so, the flavor was very good. Therefore, Wang Baole coughed and picked up the third fruit in front of everyone. This time, he ate a little slower.

This made everyone go mad. That was especially so for the red-eyed Li Linzi. He had never thought that Wang Baole would actually be able to eat the fruits. However, he felt that something was amiss.

“Is it possible that… the Starfall Envoy won’t stop you if you try a second time to take the fruit?” Although this idea felt a bit absurd, the greed in his heart was too much. After some deliberation, he clenched his teeth ruthlessly and rushed past Wang Baole toward the altar.

Five other people seemed to have the same idea as Li Linzi as they rushed towards the altar with incredible speed. However, the moment they were about to step onto the altar, the paper human cutout suddenly raised his right hand. The force that had prevented Wang Baole from approaching appeared again, blocking the crowd and fiercely pushing them away.

With a loud boom, the bodies of Li Linzi and the others all shook as they retreated rapidly. One person was hit so fiercely that blood could be seen flowing down his lips. Seeing this, they all took a deep breath and recovered from their initial frenzy.

“Huh, I didn’t expect you to be such a fool, Li Linzi. Don’t you know that since ancient times, only two people have obtained the Soul Spirit Fruits on the Starfall Boat?” Wang Baole finished the third fruit and picked up a fourth, spitting Li Linzi’s previous words right back at him.

“You!” Li Linzi’s complexion turned ugly, but he remained stubborn as if he felt that there was a chance of success if tried a second time. Therefore, he stood up and rushed towards the altar again.

“You’re still trying? Li Linzi, I admire your courage. Come on!” Wang Baole said with a smile as he picked up the fifth fruit. This time, he didn’t eat it. Instead, he held it in his hand and tossed it up and down, looking as if he needed a beating as he watched Li Linzi charge toward him. As Li Linzi neared, he was stopped once again with a wave of the paper human cutout’s hand and was sent flying.

This time, the paper human cutout seemed to be punishing Li Linzi. The force was even more violent than before, causing him to spit out a large mouthful of blood. When he landed on the ground, he staggered backwards a few steps. His face turned pale, but, when he looked at Wang Baole, both his expression and his eyes revealed intense anger and grievance!

He was furious indeed, but he was also helpless. He had no choice but to admit the difference between him and Wang Baole… The others could also tell that the Starfall Envoy was clearly biased toward Wang Baole. The scene of Wang Baole rowing the boat until he achieved a breakthrough in cultivation surfaced in their minds again.

“Why?!”

“This is too much!!”

“Helping him break through, helping him board the boat… this paper human cutout didn’t even care that Xie Dalu killed someone and robbed their spot. Now, he’s the only one allowed to eat Soul Spirit Fruits and even seems to be eating as many as he pleases… Could he be the son of Starfall?!”

The obvious favoritism made everyone feel extremely helpless. They watched as Wang Baole ate a fifth fruit in his hand and picked up a sixth. He looked as though he wanted to finish all the fruits. They forced themselves to calm down, and as various thoughts ran through their minds, the masked woman who had previously told Wang Baole about the effects of the fruit suddenly spoke.

“Fellow Daoist Xie, I am willing to buy a fruit for three million Red Crystals, is that alright?”

“How much?!” Wang Baole was about to take a bite when he heard those words. His eyes widened, and he immediately gasped. He didn’t continue eating but stared straight at the masked woman instead.

“Three million Red Crystals. This is the Xie family’s Red Crystal Card. As a member of the Xie family, you naturally know about it. Inside are exactly three million!” As she spoke, the masked woman raised her right hand, took out a red jade token, and threw it toward Wang Baole.

Wang Baole took a deep breath when he heard that. He raised his hand and pulled the jade token over. Even though he didn’t recognize it, he had seen people taking out similar items in the Xie family’s market, although none of them held so much money.

As his heart palpitated with excitement, he looked at the fruit in his hand, which had a tooth mark in it. Then he looked at the remaining fruits on the altar. He suddenly felt endless regret.

“Heavens, how many Red Crystals did I eat? Fifteen million? I…I should have sold them earlier!!”

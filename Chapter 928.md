# Chapter 928 - Li Linzi's Scheme

Upon hearing Wang Baole's words, the little fatty’s expression changed instantly. He felt indignant at how greedy this fellow in front of him was. How could there be such a greedy person in this world besides himself?

And it wasn’t just him, but all the other Chosen outside had ugly faces as well when they heard Wang Baole’s demand. They didn't care about a hundred thousand Red Crystals, but they were being extorted and had no choice but to pay. This went against their pride, and while they felt helpless, they were also furious with Wang Baole.

Alas, there was no other way. Five days seemed like a long time, but they knew that with every passing moment, their chances of successfully reaching the shore would decrease. Moreover, when Wang Baole left the boat and unleashed his full speed previously, they all realized that he was not a good person to offend.

It might be fine if they joined forces, but most likely none of them was independently a match for him. Moreover, it wouldn’t be easy to get them all to cooperate in the first place. Despite their advantage in numbers, they weren’t a team after all. They would inevitably have differing intentions.

These thoughts flashed through everyone’s minds, but for the sake of their pride, even those who were tempted were unwilling to be the first to lower their heads. Therefore, none of them opened their mouths.

Seeing that, the young fatty heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at Wang Baole and was about to say something to ease the tension, but Wang Baole noticed how the people outside were all at a loss. He snorted inwardly and decided to add fuel to the fire.

"The number of people who can board the boat is limited, and so is the window of time for my help. In the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, I will only grab thirty people. If you’re too slow, don’t blame me for not being able to enter!"

As soon as he said that, the crowd outside grew anxious. This concerned their fortune in the Starfall Realm. They had painstakingly worked hard in their respective clans and factions to obtain this chance. If they were to fail just because of a hundred thousand Red Crystals, even they would feel ashamed after returning. Therefore, after hearing Wang Baole's words, how could they not be anxious? Immediately, voices emerged from the crowd.

"I'll buy it! One!"

The first person to speak was a thin youth. This person was quick-witted. As he spoke, he also shouted out his number. That way, even if more than thirty people spoke at the same time as him, he would still be eligible.

Wang Baole also smiled and thought that this fellow was not bad. Just as he was about to nod, the others also grew anxious, and one after another, their voices rang out.

"I’ll buy! Two!"

"I'll buy! Three!"

The voices that agreed to Wang Baole's offer rose to seventy or eighty in a few short breaths. However, the number that was shouted did not exceed thirty. Naturally, many of them conflicted with each other. It caused them to glare at each other angrily,  but Wang Baole was very pleased with such a fiery scene.

He was overjoyed, but the little fatty was trembling. He had finally come to his senses. He knew that it didn't matter whether he agreed or not. If he continued to be greedy and refused to give Wang Baole money, the consequences could easily be imagined. Therefore, while everyone outside was arguing over the count, he took out a Red Crystal Card from his pocket without hesitation and threw it at Wang Baole.

"Fellow Daoist, you are the most benevolent person in the world. To support you, I, Zhou Linfeng, am the first to agree on this matter!"

Taking the card, Wang Baole looked at the little fatty with a faint smile and sighed.

"I hope that everyone in the world can understand me as you do. How can I, Xie Dalu, covet such a small amount of money? I just want to help all of you, but the Heavenly Dao stands against the human path. When I act against Heaven’s Will, I have to receive something to resist the invisible calamity."

Hearing Wang Baole's emotional outburst, the little fatty's face twitched. He secretly thought that Wang Baole's skin was too thick, and his words were nauseating, but he knew how to be flexible and adapt. He was afraid that Wang Baole would go back on his word, so he put on a sincere expression and kept nodding.

At the same time, Li Linzi and the others on the boat saw this unexpected opportunity to make money. Although they knew that Wang Baole’s situation on the boat was special, they were still tempted to try. In particular, Li Linzi thought that rather than  gaining wealth, if he could do what Wang Baole did, he could use this opportunity to earn everyone’s favor.

"Idiot, connections are the most important thing!" Li Linzi narrowed his eyes. He did not wish to offend Wang Baole too much, so he had to dismiss the idea of showing off by rebuking Wang Baole. After all, the people outside were not stupid. If he had a way to help them get in, the act of rebuking Wang Baole would naturally give him bonus points.

However, if he could not, then suspicion would fall on him for giving empty favors. Not only would he fail to achieve his goal, but it would also make people despise him instead.

At this thought, he suddenly stood up and spoke to everyone outside.

"My fellow Daoists, I am Li Linzi from the Cloud Frost Sect. Please do not be in a rush to pay. I would like to try and see if anyone who is already on board can invite others to board the ship, like Xie Dalu."

"Fellow Daoists, if I succeed, I will not ask for anything in return. I have already offended Fellow Daoist Xie by stepping forward, so if I fail, please do not blame me."

Hearing Li Linzi's words, the people outside immediately responded. Their words were filled with gratitude and understanding. Even Wang Baole narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze over Li Linzi, having seen through his intentions.

"Is it possible, he wants to curry favor with them and establish a network of connections? Li Linzi's scheme is not bad." As Wang Baole thought, a dark glint flashed in Li Linzi's eyes. After gaining the support of everyone outside, he turned and cupped his fists at Wang Baole.

"Fellow Daoist Xie, please don't stop me from trying!"

These words made killing intent flash through Wang Baole's heart. The other party's words were extremely vicious. It would have been fine if he hadn't said those words. Even though the other people's resentment towards Wang Baole wouldn't decrease, it wouldn't increase either.

However, now no matter how Wang Baole answered, it would be wrong. If he stopped Li Linzi, their resentment would naturally deepen. If he didn't stop it, it would help Li Linzi build his connections.

‘This Li Linzi is quite quick-witted!’ Wang Baole narrowed his eyes. In reality, he had already considered helping people onto the boat to build his connections. However, he knew very well that connections were the most stable but also the most fragile existence in the world. The reason why they were stable was because as long as each party could continue exchanging for what they needed, the connections would last till the end of their life.

Such exchanges were based on emotions, values, benefits, etc.

The reason why they were fragile was that if there were no benefits, they would be just like a flower in the mirror or a moon’s reflection on the water<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">[1]</a></sup>. They were of little use, and were likely to become a weakness!

That was why simply helping people onto the boat for free wouldn’t be enough to establish connections. Once he did that, it would be tantamount to setting a persona for himself, and he would have to continuously make such sacrifices in the future.

If Wang Baole was a Chosen from some powerful faction, he would have the means to do so and to even make this situation perfect for it, but he wasn't.

The resources he had obtained were what he needed the most!

Therefore, Wang Baole only smiled at Li Linzi’s act of trying to take advantage. He did not speak and allowed Li Linzi, who was secretly proud of himself, to stand up and try to pull people in.

The outcome was obvious; it was naturally a failure. Li Linzi was a little depressed. After all, since he failed, his previous words might have had some effect, but they were unable to truly establish a connection. He could only be considered to have a small foundation.

Seeing that, Wang Baole suddenly spoke.

"Would you like to give me ten million Red Crystals so that I can help you by bringing in the people outside for free?" The viciousness in his words far exceeded that of Li Linzi. After he spoke, Li Linzi's body trembled, and his expression instantly turned ugly. In his heart, he was torn. He naturally wouldn't take out ten million Red Crystals. He felt that it wasn't worth it to spend so much in exchange for building connections. Therefore, he snorted coldly and ignored Wang Baole. Instead, he cupped his fists towards the people outside.

"Fellow Daoists, it's not that I don't agree, but I am ashamed to say I don't have enough money…"

Although there was a response, it was clear that the Chosen outside had now become colder towards Li Linzi. None of them were fools. They had clearly understood what Li Linzi was thinking previously. If Li Linzi had succeeded, it would be fine, but since he failed, he was useless to them.

Wang Baole's words naturally played a role too.

Meanwhile, even though Wang Baole had set a high price, at the very least he could actually bring people onto the boat. Therefore, transactions of a hundred thousand Red Crystals soon began to be conducted.

Seeing this, Wang Baole glanced at Li Linzi and secretly shook his head. If Li Linzi had agreed, even he would have treated him as someone important. As it seemed now, he was just playing to the gallery.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">[2]</a></sup>

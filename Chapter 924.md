# Chapter 924 - The Patriarch's Sorrow

It was no wonder why they made that judgment. After all, anyone who saw the Starfall Boat and the red lightning that appeared above it would make the same conclusion.

The most important reason was that the red lightning didn’t reveal any aggressiveness, only hanging there majestically. It highlighted the spirit boat, causing the rest of the Chosen aboard the other eight Starfall Boats to look carefully in that direction.

Wang Baole and the others weren’t stupid and quickly realized what was going on. Although they felt strange in their hearts, they didn’t resolve the misunderstanding and instead chose to remain silent. Their silence only seemed to confirm the misunderstanding.

After sweeping his gaze across the other eight Starfall Boats, Wang Baole’s heart became heavy. At a glance, he estimated that the number of people aboard these boats was around four hundred. The quota for entrance into the Starfall Realm was also around four hundred people…

The weakest ones…were still much stronger than normal cultivators at the great circle of the Spirit Immortal realm. Wang Baole felt that they were about as strong as he was back before he himself had reached the great circle of the Spirit Immortal realm. Moreover, he noticed several cultivators whose cultivations seemed even higher than his own, which was puzzling.

“Although it feels like that, true battle strength isn’t determined just by your cultivation, but also by your Dharmic Armaments and combat sense…” As Wang Baole pondered with narrowed eyes, he suddenly felt some gazes from the other eight boats land on him. However, he could faintly feel that the focus of most of the gazes was the masked woman.

While everyone was checking each other out, the nine Starfall Boats gradually stopped outside the huge paper star. Suddenly, the huge paper star emitted intense white light, enveloping the paper world around them. At the same time, shocking rumbles echoed from the star.

As these rumbles sounded out, the huge paper star visibly trembled and slowly began to stretch from a spherical shape…to a human shape!

To be precise, it turned into a huge paper human cutout that looked exactly like the ones rowing the boats!

It seemed like this paper human cutout’s body was originally curled up in a ball, which made it look like a huge planet. But now, as it unfolded, its true body was revealed. The entire paper starry sky started trembling, and an indescribable pressure, capable of flattening mountains and draining seas, emitted from the paper human cutout. The pressure swept out in all directions like a storm, as if the power of thousands of Eternal Stars was converging in that huge paper body.

Everyone who looked at it couldn’t help but start trembling wildly. A stabbing pain assaulted their eyes, as if the other party could permanently blind them with a single thought. This feeling turned into a suffocating pressure!

This was because on one hand, they were horrified by its cultivation, and on the other hand, in front of that giant body, the Chosen couldn’t even be considered ants. Only after the nine spirit boats stacked on top of each other could they reluctantly be considered an ant!

“A Star Domain Almighty!!” This was the judgment that immediately came to Wang Baole’s mind after seeing the large paper human cutout and feeling its pressure. He had only felt this pressure from two other people. One was the Flame Patriarch and the other was his senior brother, Chen Qingzi.

Although the feeling was the same, there were obvious differences in strength between the three. The huge paper human cutout obviously didn’t have as vast a cultivation base as the Flame Patriarch, and compared to his senior brother, the difference was even greater.

Wang Baole wasn’t the only one who made this judgment; the other Chosen all had strong backgrounds in the Never Ending Dao Domain, so they were all able to come to their own conclusions.

At the moment the Chosen woke up from their daze and prepared to bow in greeting, the huge paper human cutout suddenly opened its eyes, revealing an icy glint. At the same time, a buzzing sound resounded across the paper starry sky.

“Welcome to the Starfall Gate!”

As soon as its words rang out, a large number of ripples spread out in all directions in the paper starry sky. This made it seem as if the paper starry sky had turned into a sea of ripples!

Along with the sea of ripples, a white paper wave suddenly appeared in the distance, rolling and rising continuously. The next moment, the wave filled everyone’s vision, causing Wang Baole and the other Chosen to lift their heads with unconcealable shock.

Even the masked woman and the other Chosen whom Wang Baole was paying attention to all had blank looks on their faces. At that moment, the big wave that was raised disappeared along with the ripples, and slowly revealed its true form!

It wasn’t a huge wave at all, it was a piece of flat paper that was folded in half and raised to one side!

If at this moment, one could stand at the highest point and look down from the black starry sky, one would clearly see…a huge piece of white paper!

Whether it was the huge paper human cutout, the nine Starfall Boats, or the nearly four hundred Chosen on board, all of them were on this white piece of paper. However, at this moment, the white paper was folded in half!

This took a while to describe, yet happened in an instant. The nine Starfall Boats, everyone inside, and the huge paper human cutout were all submerged under the folded piece of paper.

However, it didn’t end. The paper starry sky folded in half again and again. Its area was rapidly reduced, but its depth increased infinitely.

After a countless number of folds, the huge white paper in the starry sky turned into a white needle, piercing through the void as it suddenly disappeared!

Almost at the same moment as the paper needle disappeared, in the area where the huge piece of paper once was, dozens of intense auras suddenly descended. They were not true figures, only mere wills. They stared at the place where the paper once lay.

“It’s still this way…”

“Even if I look at it again, I still can’t figure out the true location of the Starfall Realm!”

“It must be related to the Underworld Law, yet there’s no clear relation between the two…”

“The Starfall Realm… one of the cracks connecting the Never-Ending Dao Domain to the Outer Domain…”

“There was also that red lightning that appeared, which was a bit strange…did it manage to go along?”

Each of these wills was an ancestor-like figure in their own respective families and clans. They gathered here not to only escort their own children, but to watch the opening of the Starfall Gate once again. They wanted to try to find out its secrets.

But obviously, this time, they had failed once again.

At the same time, in the depths of the universe, in a starry sky filled with flames, there was a huge star. This star looked like a majestic pill furnace, and it was surrounded by over a hundred Eternal Stars that constantly sent a high temperature into it. An old man sat cross-legged atop the pill furnace star.

This old man was none other than the Flame Patriarch. His originally closed eyes snapped open in this instant as he lowered his head and flipped his right hand. A sound transmission jade slip appeared in the palm of his hand. He suddenly looked up and gazed at the distant starry sky, and a smile slowly appeared at the corner of his mouth.

“The Xie family’s kid is asking for help? He wants me to intercede? He’s asking the wrong person…Heh, I have a hunch that before Chen Qingzi can kill the Sundered Moon Emperor, his junior brother will become my disciple.”

“Chen Qingzi, oh, Chen Qingzi, this is fate, isn’t it? Hehe…although I can’t beat you, if my premonition comes true, what will you call me then? Haha, interesting…interesting…I don’t know what expression that kid will have when he finds out that the person he needs help from is that boy Wang Baole…” Thinking of this situation, the Flame Patriarch couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

His laughter spread across the entire Flame Star Domain, echoing in the hearts and minds of countless individuals. Around him, eighteen illusory figures condensed and emerged as eighteen cultivators of different races. They bowed down to the Flame Patriarch.

“Greetings to Master!”

“May I ask why Master is so jubilant?” These cultivators had profound cultivation bases. Seeing that their Master was happy, they couldn’t help but ask amicably.

The Flame Patriarch, who was sitting on the huge furnace star, laughed happily once again when he heard those words.

“There is a high possibility that you lot will have another junior brother.” As he spoke, no one noticed the hidden trace of extreme sorrow in his eyes when he looked at his disciples…

“Your real junior brother…”

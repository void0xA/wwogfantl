# Chapter 923 - The Peerless, Mysterious Chosen!

“It can't be… I just made a single wish…" Wang Baole wailed internally. He could already see that whether it was in the size of a single bolt or the overall scope and power, the lightning tribulation this time far exceeded the one he’d encountered previously.

There was no comparison between the two. It was like the difference between a small pond and the vast ocean. Even a single bolt of this time’s lightning tribulation was enough to shake Wang Baole to the core. He felt a strong sense of danger.

“Will the paper human cutout know that it's because of me? Will it throw me out…” Wang Baole showed the same shock as the rest on the surface, but inwardly, his anxiety and sorrow were stronger than those of all the others combined.

He knew very well that the lightning tribulation was here for him. As long as the paper human cutout threw him out, the boat would no longer be struck by lightning.

It grew worse as he saw that the starry sky had completely turned red. Countless bolts of lightning shot towards him from all directions like the wrath of the heavens. Regardless of how sturdy the boat was, it still began to shake violently as the sea of lightning enveloped it.

The boat seemed as if it could collapse at any moment. This made Wang Baole grow even more anxious. The feelings of others on the boat weren't as intense as his, but they were also extremely nervous. In confusion, they couldn’t help but let out low roars.

"Could it be that a Star Domain Almighty is making a move?"

"That's impossible. Even a Star Domain Almighty wouldn't attack us. After all, any one of our clans and factions is powerful enough. Together… would a single Star Domain Almighty dare to attack us all?"

"Could this be a necessary procedure to get to the Starfall Realm? But this isn’t mentioned in the clan’s records."

Everyone was overwhelmed with shock and their minds churned. They had no choice but to make some preparations, planning out how they would escape once the boat collapsed. The paper human cutout's expression became serious. With a wave of its right hand, a layer of gentle light immediately enveloped the boat and blockedthe lightning coming from all directions.

A loud boom resounded in the next instant, making everyone feel deafened. The spirit boat shook even more violently, but it was still able to resist the lightning.

However, there was no time for everyone to relax. The sea of lightning seemed to have been provoked. All the lightning in the area gathered and struck again, this time with an even more shocking and exaggerated momentum.

Seeing this, the paper human cutout let out a low growl. A white glow radiated from its body and it began crazily rowing the boat at an unprecedented speed. The boat's speed became so fast that it disappeared into the distance before the lightning could even gather again. Even Wang Baole and the other passengers couldn’t adapt to the rapid acceleration.

Some people had blood seeping from the corners of their mouths, buteveryone had to hold on tightly to whatever was around them or else they would be flung out of the boat. With such an extreme speed, the Spirit Boat finally escaped the lightning tribulation. It was as if the boat had entered a wormhole, instantly appearing in a faraway place in the Starry Sky.

However, the crisis wasn’t finished. Before Wang Baole could heave a sigh of relief, lightning appeared once again in the calm starry sky and started chasing after them. The sea of lightning was so fast that it instantly caught up to the boat. Looking from afar, it continuously bombarded the spirit boat, causing the boat to shake and thunderous rumbles to unceasingly sound out.

"It’s not over yet!" Wang Baole wanted to cry but had no tears. The others also turned pale as they watched the paper human cutout rowing the boat crazily as bolts of lightning continued to fall. Fortunately, the spirit boat was extraordinary, and the paper human cutout seemed to be exerting all its strength. Therefore, although it was unable to shake off the sea of lightning after repeated teleportations, at least it wasn't trapped in the center of the sea of lightning like before.

Unfortunately… the vast sea of lightning seemed to have locked onto the spirit boat as they continued their journey. Just like that, a month passed as it chased them relentlessly. From a distance, one could see the spirit boat in front, with the sea of lightning hot on its tail. The majestic sight was enough to shock the hearts of anyone who saw it.

Some people even developed a misconception, thinking that it was a part of the spirit boat’s divine abilities. The bolts of lightning that continued to strike the spirit boat were like iron chains, causing the sea of lightning behind it to look like a peacock spreading its tail. This also highlighted the impressiveness of the spirit boat.

However, this was something that neither Wang Baole nor the dozens of Chosen on the boat wanted. During this time, no one spoke and everyone’s faces were pale, even the masked woman’s. Their eyes were filled with fear and they were unable to meditate peacefully.

Similarly, the paper human cutout didn’t like this either.

Wang Baole didn't know if he was hallucinating, but he could vaguely see that the paper human cutout's forehead was sweating. This made him tremble even more. He secretly vowed that he would never indiscriminately use the wishing bottle again.

“How is this a wishing bottle? This is clearly a divine artifact used for committing suicide!” Wang Baole’s heart was filled with grief and indignation. Another half a month passed like this.

The sea of lightning… continued its relentless pursuit. At the same time, the Spirit Boat slowed down and entered… an unusual starry sky!

Wang Baole did not notice how it entered. It seemed as if the boat had teleported on its own, and the sky had changed almost instantly.

It was a white cosmos. To be more precise, the color of the sky was the color of white paper. Furthermore, looking around, the entire area was like white paper. That was especially so for the stars of various sizes in the white cosmos. When one looked at them, they were all… blank paper!

The spirit boat slowly came to a stop in front of a gigantic white paper planet!

"White paper cosmos, white paper stars, this is the gate of the Starfall Realm!!" Someone on the boat immediately exclaimed excitedly. The reason they were so excited was because they felt that once they arrived, the lightning might not appear again.

However, in reality… even though the sea of lightning didn't appear at first, it only took a dozen breaths. In the white cosmos, the red sea of lightning descended with a loud rumble and spread rapidly towards Wang Baole on the spirit boat.

"It's all over!" Wang Baole's eyes widened. The others around him couldn't help but let out anguished wails. But perhaps the white cosmos, where the gate to the Starfall Realm was located, had its own peculiarities. Even though the red sea of lightning chased after Wang Baole, it stopped behind the spirit boat. Although it looked terrifying, it didn't drown the ethereal spirit boat; instead, red bolts of lightning continuously struck the area right behind the ethereal spirit boat.

This process continued for half a month. During that time, Wang Baole and the others were extremely nervous. Even the paper human cutout seemed to be waiting vigilantly.

Half a month later, a second spirit boat suddenly appeared in the distance of the white cosmos!

Next was a third, fourth, up until the ninth Spirit Boat. Wang Baole finally understood that there were not one but nine Starfall Boats!

He couldn't help but look at the other eight boats. He wanted to see if there was any elite powerhouse in the other boats. Wang Baole wasn't the only one. The others on his boat did the same and so did the Chosen on the other eight boats. However, everyone from the other boats looked at the boat Wang Baole was on at the same time!

The boat that Wang Baole and company were on was simply too shocking. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that it was the undisputed center of attention. Many people were stunned. That was because, in the white cosmos, the red sea of lightning was even more eye-catching than a blazing torch in the night!

They didn't know that the sea of lightning had been chasing after the spirit boat. That was why, as the sea of lightning floated and exuded a suppressive force, they instinctively thought that the spirit boat was extraordinary!

"Could it be that there's a peerless Chosen on this boat who's using this method to intimidate us?" Many people narrowed their eyes, revealing a look of vigilance. At the same time, they began to make speculations in their hearts!

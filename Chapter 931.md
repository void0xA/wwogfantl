# Chapter 931 - A Good Deal!

"This..." Wang Baole hesitated for a moment. He wanted to say that he dared, but the difference in Laws meant that the way for him to cultivate this technique was also completely different. Without reference and comparison, it was difficult for him to figure it out unless he personally examined the cultivation method.
Therefore, the other party could very easily create fake techniques. Even if the techniques were real, if he thoughtlessly cultivated them, they might just turn his entire body into paper.
Only if he could see and understand the technique with his own eyes and guarantee its authenticity would it be possible for him to try and cultivate it. However, it would still be extremely dangerous.
Thinking to this point, Wang Baole shook his head and forced a smile.
“You really don’t dare? This book can be considered the best cultivation technique in my entire shop. It’s called the Nine Reading Paper Secret Art! You can infuse the laws of paper into your mystical techniques, destroying all your enemies at a touch… One of my Starfall Empire’s powerhouses once went to the Outer Realm and used this technique to turn many Outer Realm cultivators into paper, wiping them out.” As the old man spoke, he raised his right hand to grab at the void. Suddenly, a piece of golden paper placed at the top of a shelf flew towards him and fell into his hand.
“Although you can’t cultivate it yourself, it’s still worth buying as a collectible, right?” The old man looked at Wang Baole, obviously pleased at his depressed expression of wanting the technique but being unable to cultivate it.
“Senior…” Wang Baole was about to speak, but the old man coughed and waved his right hand again.
“Not that one? How about this one, it’s called the Fire Ape Curse. When one uses it, they will transform into a giant fire ape. Even an Eternal Star Realm cultivator will have a headache dealing with them!”
“This technique is also extraordinary, it’s called One Thought Stellar Brilliance Art. it can transform a star into a paper star, then it can be folded evoking good fortune” The old man flaunted one technique after another, describing their power in detail. Wang Baole couldn’t help but release a sigh as he listened. He patted his storage bag and suddenly a jade slip appeared in his hand. 
“Senior, this junior doesn’t know whether you can see the jade slip in my hand, but this technique is called the Heavenspan No Will Secret Art. Once it is completed, no one else’s divine will can exist where you are. Everything shall be determined by your own will, surpassing this realm and becoming supreme!” Wang Baole said lightly while holding the jade slip of a map.
The old man was stunned by these words, but Wang Baole continued before he could speak.
“If you’re unsatisfied, this cultivation method is called Kunpeng Swallows the Dao. Once you cultivate it to completion, you can transform into a Kunpeng and swallow everything, it can be called a supreme cultivation method!”
"Not satisfied? It doesn't matter. The Xie family where I, Xie Dalu am from, is the wealthiest family in the entire Never-Ending Dao Domain. I have a lot of skills. For example, this method is called the Invincible Three Knocks. Don't look down on it due its weird name, its power is beyond imagination. Once it is cultivated, the first knock can dry up a sea, the second knock can make the earth collapse, and the third knock can even make stars fall!" Wang Baole took out three or four jade slips in one breath. These jade slips, containing a mix of maps and blanks, were placed in front of the old man with a dull expression.

"Senior, do you dare to learn?" Wang Baole coughed and asked again. In fact, he realized that the old man was obviously trying to cheat him, so Wang Baole felt that he had to let the other party experience a similar feeling.

"Are you here to try to obtain a planet, or to sell things?" The old man looked at Wang Baole strangely, then snorted after a long while.

"The Xie family? I have indeed heard of it, no wonder you’re trying to sell things… fine, let's exchange!" As he spoke, the old man quickly passed the four pieces of paper in his hand to Wang Baole.

Wang Baole was stunned for a moment, but he still passed the jade slips in his hand to the old man and completed the transaction with the other party as quickly as possible. Afterwards, his heart beat faster and faster as he ran away.

The old man didn’t stop him from leaving, and was instead a little nervous until he was certain that Wang Baole had left. He looked at the jade sip in his hand with a smile on his face, feeling extremely proud.

"Haha, I exchanged a few pieces of junk paper for jade slips from the Outer Realm. It doesn't matter if there are any cultivation methods in it, as long as the material is fine, it's not bad, this thing is a rare item. After the group of people from the Outer Realm leave, it will be a rare commodity for sure!”

At the same time, Wang Baole, who just left the shop, was breathing rapidly. He looked at the few pieces of paper in his hand with bright eyes, feeling very excited.

"A few rubbish jade slips in exchange for these cultivation methods? Even if the cultivation methods inside are very low-level, if I take them outside of the Starfall Realm, it would definitely fool a lot of people. No matter how I sell it, it would still be more expensive than the jade slips... such a good deal!" Thinking of this, Wang Baole's interest suddenly increased, and he simply went to every shop that sold cultivation methods or magical treasures.

Like this, two days passed by in a flash. During these two days, Wang Baole went to many shops and exchanged for a lot of pieces of paper with junk jade slips, but he felt regretful that his tricks hadn’t worked in the Dharmic Artifact shop.

"Who would have thought that the Dharmic Artifacts of the Starfall Empire were actually drawn on pieces of paper..." Wang Baole sighed and raised his right hand. A piece of paper appeared in his hand with a sword drawn on it.

In order to trade for this Dharmic Artifact, he had to take out more than a dozen junk artifacts of his own to get the owner to just barely agree, but as Wang Baole held it in his hand, he couldn’t help feeling like a fool…
"Forget it, the trial will start tomorrow. Let's just calm down and keep my cultivation at the ready." Wang Baole shook his head and threw the paper in his hand into his storage bag, together with hundreds of other papers. After that, he walked towards his lodging.
He quickly returned and was about to step in and go back to his room, but at that moment, a group of people came out from the door of the inn, chatting and laughing.

Among the crowd, the leader was one of the strongest four from the first trial. She was a graceful and charming woman who smiled before she spoke and wore a colorful long dress to hide her graceful figure. There was a bell on her white wrists, and as she walked, the sound of the bell rang extremely clear.

As for the seven or eight people around her, Wang Baole saw Li Linzi, the young fatty, and one more person, with a tall, straight figure and a very arrogant expression. The most attractive thing was his hairstyle, which was very exaggeratedly tied together, towering high in the air.
Moreover, his hair seemed to contain a special spell, actually radiating light. When Wang Baole saw this person, he became stunned for a moment, thinking he was looking at a walking light bulb.

In his entire life, the only person he’d met who could compare with this person in terms of hairstyle was Xie Haiyang's rich hairspray, but after careful comparison, Wang Baole had to admit that Xie Haiyang was probably inferior to this person.

"An expert?" Wang Baole murmured in his heart. He was about to pass by them and enter the inn, but when Li Linzi saw Wang Baole, his eyes flashed sarcasm, and he smiled at the master beside him.

"Brother Gao, didn't you ask me before about who was insane and shameless enough to sell passes at the last trial for 100,000 red crystals? That is him. Not only did he sell passes, he also killed the Purple Gold Civilization’s Chosen and stole their quota!"

At Li Linzi’s words, the expert immediately looked at Wang Baole. Even the girl with the bell turned her beautiful eyes to stare at Wang Baole.
Wang Baole raised his eyebrows. He was not a person who could swallow his anger. Hearing Li Linzi speak like this, he immediately looked over with cold eyes.

"Li Linzi, the next time you talk to me like this, I will kill you." Wang Baole spoke calmly, but the seriousness of his expression and the murderous intent in his eyes made Li Linzi' suddenly pause. For some unknown reason, some chills rose in his heart.

After speaking, Wang Baole didn't pay any more attention to Li Linzi, but nodded to the man named Gao and the bell girl, then turned around and walked into the inn. Li Linzi's complexion was extremely ugly, and his eyes flickered with murderous intent as he stared at Wang Baole’s back. Wang Baole seemed completely unguarded, so Li Linzi couldn’t help but want to make a move, but the bell girl suddenly spoke.

"Fellow Daoist Li Linzi, I advise you not to attack him. He deliberately provoked you!"

"Have you forgotten the rules here? Once you take the initiative to make a move, you will lose your quota. After losing your quota, not only would you not be able to participate in the trial, but he would be completely free to kill you. The rules are set that only those who have a quota are not allowed to fight!" Bell Girl said lightly, and she looked at Wang Baole's back with some interest. It wasn’t the kind between a man and a woman, but more like she was looking at an underling.

"Meddlesome!" Wang Baole muttered in his heart after hearing them and stopped circulating the Nightmare Eyes Art.

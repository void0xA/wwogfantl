# Chapter 918 - Obtaining a Spot in the Quota!

From the moment Wang Baole appeared, to the moment the Eternal Star Realm Almighty Daoist Lin Hai stepped forward to stop him, to the moment the paper human cutout waved its paper oar, to the moment the white waves carried Wang Baole onto the boat, to the moment he rushed towards the Violet Gold civilization’s Heavenly Chosen… everything happened almost instantly!

It all happened so fast that everyone was caught off guard, and it was so smooth that it seemed like it had been rehearsed countless times. Among the shouts of alarm of the other Heavenly Chosen on the boat and the roar of Patriarch Lin Hai outside of it, Wang Baole struck like a thunderbolt. The Emperor’s Armor appeared, and the Divine Armament drew a resplendent arc across the starry sky as it struck towards… the Violet Gold Heavenly Chosen, Xing Ling!

If it were any other cultivator at the great circle of the Spirit Immortal Realm, they wouldn’t have been able to react quickly enough to the sudden turn of events. This slash from Wang Baole would have killed them instantly!

But Xing Ling was the sole Dao Child candidate in this generation of the Violet Gold civilization, after all. Even though the Violet Gold civilization was nothing in the eyes of the major factions, it was still the overlord of the Left Dao’s nineteenth region. The resources it had access to far exceeded those of the Divine Eye civilization or the Federation, and its wars of conquest against other civilizations were even more frequent. Therefore, thanks to his astonishing resources and plentiful battle experience, although the crisis came swiftly, Xing Ling still displayed his extraordinary capabilities.

He was shocked for a moment, but he didn’t dodge. Instead, he instinctively… ignited his cultivation base!

He didn’t only ignite his cultivation base. At that moment, his fire of life erupted forth, causing dreadful flames to flare up all over his body. He let out a low growl, and the flames transformed into a giant red tiger that pounced towards Wang Baole.

Wang Baole’s pupils contracted. This was his first confrontation with the Heavenly Chosen of a large faction, and he immediately felt that they were difficult to deal with. It was evident that these Heavenly Chosen not only had much stronger combat power, but also a far greater battle sense than other cultivators.

It was just that… Wang Baole hadn’t originally planned to completely exterminate the other party in body and soul, but with how the opponent was burning his own life force, Wang Baole was unable to guarantee whether he would be able to leave this person alive!

‘Although his reaction is quick, he doesn’t understand his current situation. He’s screwing himself over!’ As this thought flashed through Wang Baole’s mind, the two figures directly collided on the boat.

A boom quickly echoed out, spreading in all directions. Looking from a distance, one could see Wang Baole’s Divine Armament landing on the red tiger’s head, cleanly slicing it in two. After being cut apart, the red tiger didn’t have enough energy to continue fighting and directly exploded. The explosion didn't force Wang Baole back, but it forced the tiger back, and Xing Ling’s retreating figure appeared from the flames. He was clearly trying to gain some distance from Wang Baole so that he could find a way out of his passive position.

A battle between two people with similar cultivation bases and combat power was really just a battle to seize the initiative. Once one of them gained the initiative, the other would lose control of the situation. The passive one would quickly find themselves in an unfavorable position and might even directly be defeated.

Thus, the Violet Gold Heavenly Chosen Xing Ling’s attack and subsequent retreat made the other Heavenly Chosen in the boat show a strange gleam in their eyes as they backed up to avoid the battle. Clearly, Xing Ling’s reaction in this moment of crisis of not even hesitating before decisively burning his cultivation and life force had won their recognition.

Wang Baole also had plentiful combat experience, and he had known what role initiative played in a battle since very early on in his cultivation journey. His opponent wanted to retreat, but how could he allow it? That was especially so since he didn’t want this battle to drag out for too long. Although he was now on the boat and the paper human cutout had helped him earlier, he didn’t have a spot in the quota!

Outside, Daoist Lin Hai’s fury filled the air, causing the Starry Sky to distort. Wang Baole needed to get a spot on the boat as soon as possible, otherwise… once he was kicked off the boat, what awaited him would be certain death!

In fact, that was indeed the case. The moment Wang Baole appeared, he had immediately boarded the boat and attacked the Violet Gold Civilization’s Heavenly Chosen. The attack was too vicious and everything happened too suddenly, making Patriarch Lin Hai burn with enough fury to raze the entire Divine Eye civilization. Moreover, Patriarch Lin Hai's own attack had been blocked, making him lose face. His cultivation erupted frantically, especially when he saw his Heavenly Chosen unhesitatingly burn his cultivation base. His killing intent and anger towards Wang Baole had reached its peak.

“Little bastard, you’re courting death!” Patriarch Lin Hai went completely berserk. As he roared, an enormous illusory Eternal Star appeared behind him. The giant ball of fire exuded an indescribably high temperature and an unfathomable pressure as it charged towards the spirit boat, seeming as if it wanted to board the boat by force.

But how could he touch something like the spirit boat with his mere Eternal Star Realm cultivation? If this boat that had been specially prepared by the Starfall Realm was really so frail, the Never Ending Clan would have long since grasped the Starfall Realm’s secrets. It would no longer be a legendary place, but instead the Never Ending Clan’s private property.

Therefore, Patriarch Lin Hai was doomed to fail. Even if he gathered all the strength of his Eternal Star, the spirit boat seemed transparent, as if it wasn’t even in the same space as him. No matter what he did, all his divine abilities would only pass harmlessly through the boat, not damaging it in the slightest!

Seeing this scene, even though Wang Baole tried to ignore it, the sense of urgency in his heart only grew more intense. Thus, as he looked at the Violet Gold civilization’s Heavenly Chosen Xing Ling, his face filled with killing intent, and fury rose in his heart. As Xing Ling used the red tiger’s collapse to retreat, a cold glint flashed through Wang Baole’s eyes. With a wave of his right hand, he took the remodeled Megaphone out from his storage bag!

After being remodeled, the Megaphone had already surpassed the level of a Ninth Grade Dharmic Armament. Although it hadn’t yet reached the level of a Divine Armament, it was enough to affect Spirit Immortals. Since Wang Baole was in a hurry, he couldn’t care about damaging it. The moment he brought it out, he directly put it in front of him and roared with all his might.

***ROAR!!***

His roar was like a sudden clap of thunder. The megaphone absorbed the sound and amplified it with its full power, making it several times louder. Instantly, the megaphone released a violent sonic boom and ripples visible to the naked eye shot outwards.

As the sound wave burst forth, cracking sounds could faintly be heard from the megaphone. Clearly, it had been overloaded and couldn’t support that level of power.

The ripples were too fast, and in the next instant, they had already enveloped the retreating Xing Ling. The sound was impossible to describe; it temporarily deafened all those who heard it and even struck them with dizziness, causing the faces of those surrounding chosen to turn dazed for a while. Even after they recovered, their faces were still filled with shock.

They were already like this, let alone Xing Ling, who had ignited his cultivation and been heavily injured. As the ripples enveloped him, his body shook as if he had been struck by a heavy blow. The deafening sound drowned out his shrill screams and directly caused him to go deaf. His vision blurred, and an uncontrollable dizziness made him lose his ability to fight.

He wanted to resist, but could Wang Baole give him the opportunity? The moment Xing Ling lost his ability to fight, Wang Baole’s figure approached like lightning.

Patriarch Lin Hai’s eyes almost popped out of his head when he saw this scene.

“Little bastard, you dare to injure my Violet Gold’s Heavenly Chosen and snatch his spot? This old man swears that he will kill all living things in your Divine Eye civilization!”

“You’re threatening me?” Wang Baole snorted coldly. Without slowing down at all, he immediately raised his right hand and snatched the paper quota card from Xing Ling’s hand!

As for Xing Ling himself, Wang Baole naturally couldn’t just kill him. Instead, he raised his right hand to form a seal and patted Xing Ling on the forehead before throwing him into his storage bag. After that, he looked outside the boat at Patriarch Lin Hai, whose eyes had turned crimson with killing intent!

“Only when I return and everything is safe and sound here will it be time to release your Heavenly Chosen!”

After finishing speaking, he ignored the unsightly complexion on Patriarch Lin Hai’s face. Instead, he raised the paper card high and shouted at the paper human cutout, who was rowing the boat, while everyone else stared in shock.


“Many thanks, Senior. I now have a spot for the quota!”

The paper human looked at Wang Baole and nodded slightly before it started paddling with the paper oar in its hand. Immediately, the boat shook and resumed its journey, slowly heading into the distance!

The Heavenly Chosen on the boat all had complicated looks in their eyes. As they looked at Wang Baole, they felt as if he was giving off a light that suppressed them all. All of them fell silent.

In this battle, Wang Baole didn’t only win a spot in the quota. He also won… recognition for his strength!

# Chapter 933 - Illusory Planet!

Wang Baole's hair instantly stood on end when he heard the voice and he fiercely looked around. However, there was nobody else in the room except for himself. Even when he spread out his Divine Sense, he couldn't find anything.

The voice seemed to have been Wang Baole's hallucination, and it didn't reappear. Wang Baole remained vigilant for a long while and even tried to call out to it. Seeing that there was still no response, he opened his storage bag and quickly checked the storage ring inside. His expression gradually turned ugly.

He was very sure that he hadn't heard wrongly previously. Furthermore, that sharp voice was also familiar. It gave him the same feeling as the laugh of the paper human cutout that had left his storage ring!

‘Did it not leave… or did it return after leaving?’ Wang Baole knew that there was nothing in his storage bag except the wishing bottle and the Star Domain Bow. However, he had a vague feeling that the paper human cutout… might be at his side!

‘Never mind, this paper human cutout must be scheming something. Otherwise, why would it return?’ Wang Baole pretended to be relaxed as he sat down again with his legs crossed. He seemed to be adjusting his cultivation, but in reality, all sorts of thoughts were running through his mind. His Divine Sense continued to linger in the surroundings.

Just like that, half a day passed slowly. By now, the other Chosen had gotten used to this boat, which had no paper human cutout rowing it and seemed to be pulled along by a mysterious force. Some of them even left their rooms and gathered together in small groups.

There were around a dozen of these groups of various sizes, and one of them was formed by Li Linzi. The little fatty was in this group, and so was the expert brother with towering hair.

However, there were also many who ignored the others and preferred to stay alone. For example, the masked woman and the cold black-robed cultivator with a murderous aura sat alone in different spots. The other two people that Wang Baole had paid close attention to previously clearly had prominent identities.

There were more than twenty people gathered around the bell woman. Although the expert brother wasn't among them, the cultivators who had gathered around the bell woman all flattered her with cautious expressions. They tried to hide the admiration in their eyes, but it was still obvious.

As for the scholarly cultivator, he seemed to be used to being the center of attention. Lowering his head to read his book, he didn’t pay any attention to the dozens of people around him. However, the people gathered around him were clearly paying attention to his every move and would rush forward immediately if needed.

It was precisely because of the crowd splitting up into groups that Wang Baole could hear them discuss among each other in low voices. Of course, most of these discussions were not secrets, so no one deliberately tried to hide anything. For example, he found out the identity of the bell woman!

‘She’s from the Nine Phoenix Heavenly Sect which ranks third in terms of overall strength in the Unorthodox Holy Region!’ Wang Baole narrowed his eyes. If it was before he had learned about the Unorthodox and Heretic Dao Holy Regions, he wouldn’t have much of an impression of this so-called Nine Phoenix Heavenly Sect, but now it was completely different.

He knew very well that the Nine Phoenix Heavenly Sect was a faction countless times more powerful than the Violet Gold civilization. It probably wasn’t much inferior to the Xie Family, and to a certain extent, they could be ranked on the same level.

At the same time, Wang Baole also learned the origins of the scholarly cultivator. To a certain extent, this person could be considered as someone from the same hometown as him… because they were both from the Heretic Dao Holy Region. However, this person was the only personal disciple of a certain Deputy Dao Master in the Nine Province Dao, which was ranked first in the Heretic Dao Holy Region!

It could be said that with his status, he could make the Violet Gold civilization panic with a single sentence. After all, in terms of affiliation, the Violet Gold civilization was subordinate to the Nine Province Dao.

Wang Baole also heard about the background of that expert brother. He came from the Never-Ending Dao Domain and was from a merchant clan that had risen up after the Xie family. Their influence wasn’t inferior to the Xie Family, especially in the past few thousand years. From the looks of it, they could barely compete with the Xie family.

There must be a reason why the Xie family had allowed them to grow.

‘Their backgrounds are not simple,’ Wang Baole pursed his lips and thought to himself, ‘but this daddy isn’t bad either. The Underworld Sect’s Underworld Child. And my Senior Brother is even more awesome. If I speak out loud about it, many people would be scared to death.’ 

Thinking like this, his heart became tranquil. He also saw that the masked woman didn't want to reveal her identity and refused to interact with everyone. As for the youth dressed in black and carrying a longsword on his back, he didn't seem to have any background. Furthermore, he was clearly wary and hostile towards anyone who approached him.

This let Wang Baole find some clues, but the boat only sailed for a single day. If only there was more time, Wang Baole believed that he could gain more information.

As Wang Baole used his Divine Sense to listen in on the others, many cultivators were doing the same. However, many things that were new to Wang Baole were information that they had long since known about. Therefore, they didn't pay much attention to them. What they were most concerned about… was Wang Baole's background!

After all, even if Wang Baole didn’t think his emergence and rise were peerless beyond compare, his hatefulness in the eyes of others was very high.

It would have been fine if he was just hateful, but his strength was good too. In fact, he seemed to be comparable to the four strongest Chosen. Therefore, he naturally attracted the attention of many people.

“Xie Dalu? The Xie family? I've never heard of such a name in the Xie family. Ah! This name… reminds me of the ignorant, incompetent, and extremely shameless Xie Haiyang from the Xie family.”

"He plundered the Violet Gold civilization’s quota? In front of you all, despite being attacked by an Eternal Star Almighty, he forcefully boarded the ship and even captured the Violet Gold civilization’s Chosen?"

"What? The Starfall Envoy didn't stop him from taking the Soul Spirit Fruit!?"

"He was even allowed to row the boat and have its immortal force cleanse his body?"

As news of these incidents was spread, every person who learned of them was visibly moved. They all swept their Divine Sense towards Wang Baole's room. Even the bell woman, the scholarly cultivator, and the black-robed youth did the same. Everything that Wang Baole did was indeed shocking.

No one except him had ever rowed the Starfall Boat before. Although he was not the first person to eat the Soul Spirit Fruit, the identity of the first person was too big. It was impossible for everyone to not make comparisons and associations.

Coupled with the fact that Wang Baole was selling Soul Spirit Fruits and the quota to board the boat<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">[1]</a></sup>… these sorts of actions that reeked of desperation for red crystals made all the cultivators have strange looks on their faces.

"Did this guy go crazy because of poverty?"

"I now believe that he belongs to the Xie family!"

"I think he's most likely Xie Haiyang's younger brother!"

When Wang Baole heard the discussions, he coughed. He had originally planned to ignore them, but when he heard someone say that he was Xie Haiyang's younger brother, he became unhappy and secretly thought, “This daddy should be the elder brother!”

However, it wasn't good for him to explain this matter. Besides, such guesses were also beneficial to him. So after snorting unhappily, Wang Baole didn't pay too much attention to it. Instead, he raised his head and looked out the window at the Black Paper Sea outside.

At the end of his gaze was a gigantic ball floating above the Black Paper Sea in the distance. Taking a closer look, it could be seen that the ball was actually a planet!

In fact, such planets could often be seen on the Black Paper Sea over the course of the day’s voyage. They seemed to be coming from a different direction than the ocean the Chosen had arrived from. That’s why they had not appeared previously but could frequently be seen now.

They didn't seem big, but Wang Baole had a feeling that once he stepped in, heaven and earth would immediately reverse and turn into a world.

"A planet floating on the surface of the sea…" As he muttered to himself, the day's voyage gradually came to an end. As the speed of the boat slowed down, not only Wang Baole, but all the cultivators on the boat also saw a unique planet above the sea in the distance!

This planet seemed to be like a dream. At first glance, some people couldn't see anything, while others could only see a cloud of dense fog. When they took a second look, the scene changed again, as if the planet was constantly changing. Regardless of how it changed, after looking at it for a long time, everyone could see that it was a planet!

"Illusory Planet?!" As the two words surfaced in everyone's minds, the Illusory Planet expanded infinitely in an instant. With a speed that couldn't be followed by one's eyes, it grew to its peak. It gave people the illusion that it was even more majestic than the entire Black Paper Sea. Then, it seemed to swallow the boat that everyone was on… and the boat directly merged into it!

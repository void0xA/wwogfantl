# Chapter 934 - Killed an Eternal Star Realm Cultivator?

This trial planet of the Starfall Realm was called the Illusory Planet, but in fact it had mountains, rivers, and vegetation.

However, the color of the plants and trees was blue, and the rivers were as white as milk. The sky glowed with a multitude of colors, giving off a wondrous aura.

The rest of the planet was just as Wang Baole would have expected. He could even see some lizards crawling around on the dark ground from time to time, making the planet seem full of life.

"This is a Special Planet!" As Wang Baole was looking around, a voice came from behind him. It was one of the cultivators who had purchased a spot on the boat from him. At that moment, there was a look of uncontrollable excitement on the cultivator’s face, as if he wanted to try and fuse with the planet.

As for the boat they had arrived on, it had already disappeared, as if it had been swallowed by the planet. Everything except the Chosen themselves had disappeared, and when the Chosen regained their senses, the hundreds of them were all grouped closely together.

Although the quickly separated and looked around, many people had realized that this was a Special Planet even before that person had opened his mouth. Some of them quickly tried to fuse with it before realizing that it was impossible.

"How extravagant. It’s just a trial but they directly took out a Special Planet…" Wang Baole was very clear about the value of a Special Planet. It surpassed Mortal, Spirit, and Immortal Planets and was second only to the legendary Dao Planet. This sort of planet had the power of laws built into it, and once a cultivator fused with one, they would gain mastery over all of its laws.

Wang Baole had never encountered a Planet Realm cultivator with the power of laws so far. Most of those he encountered broke through with Spirit Planets, so he had no idea of the strength of a Planet Realm cultivator with a Special Planet.

"Mastery over the laws…" Wang Baole’s eyes showed a hint of longing. It would be fine if he hadn’t come to the Starfall Realm, but now that he had, an ordinary Spirit Planet couldn’t satisfy him anymore. Even an Immortal Planet would make him feel regret. His goal… was a Special Planet!

Special Planets were extremely difficult to find in the outside world, but here… it didn’t seem too difficult to find them at all!

Only in this way could he maintain his unrivaled strength in each realm he achieved. This was very important to him. After all, just from this short trip to the Starfall Realm alone, Wang Baole had encountered a plethora of talents from all over.

He didn’t want to leave the Starfall realm being able to beat all of these talents, only to meet them again in the future and be crushed, whether in terms of cultivation or combat power.

While this thought was churning in his mind,  Wang Baole looked down at the ground under his feet. The power of the Stellar Nascent Soul in his body made him feel a formidable blessing emanating from the planet. If he fought here, his battle prowess would certainly be greatly enhanced.

'According to the rules previously stated by the Starfall Empire, there are 30 illusion crystals in this Illusory Planet, and a person holding an illusion crystal will be promoted to the next round of the trials after seven days!'

'Hundreds of people are going to be competing over a mere 30 illusion crystals, around 90% of them will be eliminated… It seems that battle is inevitable!' Wang Baole’s eyes flashed brightly.

It wasn’t just Wang Baole, either; the other cultivators also had strange looks in their eyes. Just as Wang Baole became spirited and planned on domineeringly grabbing an illusion crystal as soon as possible… Suddenly, all of the hundreds of Chosen emitted a flickering light from their bodies.

The light coming from everyone’s bodies was the same intensity, and the moment it radiated out, large swathes of illusory figures immediately appeared in the surrounding void.

There were men and women, old and young, and even from a variety of different races. Many of them seemed to be shattered, and some of them had been burned with nothing of their bodies remaining except vague shadows.

As they appeared, bursts of pressure seemed to gather, and heaven and earth seemed to explode. Although these figures seemed mindless and maintained the forms of people at the moment of death, the cultivation base fluctuations rolling off their bodies were unmistakably real.

Looking around, there were already more than several thousand such figures, but… it wasn’t over yet, and more figures appeared with each passing moment.

Exclamations rang out from the group of Chosen. It was obvious that they recognized some of these figures as people who had been killed by them!

The same was true for Wang Baole. He saw the Never-Ending Clan member whom he’d killed, he saw the cultivators who had died by his hands, and he even saw some people whom he’d killed back in the Federation among these illusory figures.

This… was the manifestation of the Illusory Planet’s laws. It wasn’t reviving the dead, but it created illusions of everyone that someone had ever killed, even allowing the illusions to gain the same strength as the victim from when they were alive!

As more and more illusory figures appeared in the surroundings, Wang Baole noticed that the strongest ones were still only at the Spirit Immortal Realm. But he suddenly trembled and remembered… he seemed to have wiped out an entire clan on a certain planet once…

As soon as this thought appeared in his mind, the illusory figures all around him suddenly multiplied… At least tens of thousands of densely-packed lizard-like figures appeared in the surroundings.

In the blink of an eye, heaven and earth seemed to have turned upside down, causing everyone in the surroundings to be shocked.

"Who killed so many people!"

"What the hell, did they exterminate an entire clan?"

Wang Baole blinked guiltily before realizing that it seemed difficult to accurately locate the sources of these figures. Surprised but relieved, he revealed an ugly expression on his face and looked around with a glare, as if wanting to find the culprit.

Naturally, there was no other culprit to be found. However, the laws of the Illusory Planet hadn’t finished manifesting yet. Soon… seven people among the crowd glowed even brighter. The light coming from them was very conspicuous, because aside from those seven people, the light coming from everyone else was still the same!

Wang Baole was one of the seven. As for the other six, there was the quartet of the masked woman from the first trial, that expert brother with impressive hair, and the last… seemed to be a young girl of only 13-14 years of age. This little girl seemed weak and harmless, and she didn’t stand out in the crowd before this. She was part of Li Linzi’s team and even seemed to not have a high position.

Even Wang Baole hadn’t paid much attention to her before, so when he saw her at that moment, he was taken aback.

There were still differences when it came to the light emanating off of the strongest seven. The brightest light came from the young man in black with a big sword on his back. It was dazzling to behold.

As for the weakest, it was that expert brother. Wang Baole was situated somewhere in the middle, neither high nor low. As the powerful light attracted the attention of the crowd, the countless illusory figures all around suddenly trembled and rapidly retreated.

Just as the illusory figures retreated, more than 50 new figures appeared with a bang. These figures were all in miserable states, but what erupted from their bodies were… the fluctuations of a Planet Realm cultivation base!

Their expressions weren’t dull but filled with hatred as they looked at the seven people who had killed them!

"Planet Realm!"

"Those seven people have actually killed Planet Realm cultivators!"

"So many of them as well!"

While everyone was in an uproar, in a white paper hall at the center of the Starfall Empire’s capital, there were 5 paper human cutouts sitting cross-legged, staring at a basin of black liquid in front of them.

A massive number of white dots was floating within this liquid. Each white dot… was a planet. At that moment, among the densely packed white dots, one of them unexpectedly turned red!

This red spot immediately made all five paper human cutouts gape in shock.

"This is… the Illusory Planet where the Outer Realm’s Chosen are taking their trial?"

"A red spot actually appeared!"

"The laws of that low level Illusory Planet will only reach their limit once they try to manifest an Eternal Star Realm cultivator. This is impossible…"

"The Outer Realm people who come here are all Spirit Immortal Realm cultivators. How could one of them have killed an Eternal Star Realm cultivator?"

"Impossible!"
